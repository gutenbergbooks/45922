<h2>INTRODUCTION<a class="pagenum" name="page_007" title="7"> </a></h2>


<p>The voyage of the submarine merchantman
"Deutschland" has, for a long time past, been the
subject of eager speculation among the nations of
the Old and New worlds.</p>

<p>The wildest rumours regarding the fate of our
cruise have appeared in the newspapers, to say
nothing of the pretty imaginative stories in which
the English have announced again and again that
we were stranded or sunk, or, still worse, dispatched
to America in bales of cargo.</p>

<p>How often we chuckled on board when our wireless
operator picked up one of these nice English
wild goose stories from the air!</p>

<p>It is with all the greater pleasure, therefore, that
I am now about to start on this account of our
fairy-like cruise and adventures. Not that it was
such a "fairy-like" business after all. It could
hardly be that, for we went as far out of the way of
adventure as possible.</p>

<p>Readers must not therefore expect to find in this
little book a series of thrilling experiences such as
are to be met with in the published narratives of
the voyages of battleships. Our task was to
bring our valuable cargo to America as smoothly
and with as few incidents as possible; to get the
better of the English blockade, and to return safely
<a class="pagenum" name="page_008" title="8"> </a>
with an equally valuable cargo. This we succeeded
in doing, as the following account will show. But
as events will prove, things did not by any means
always work as smoothly as they might have done,
and if at times we were in a pretty tight corner and
much occurred that was not on our programme,
my readers must thank the amiable activities of the
English for all these exciting little incidents.</p>

<p>In spite of such things, however, our enemies were
not able to hinder our voyage, though they certainly
helped very materially in making it more varied
and interesting, and it would be ingratitude on our
part not to acknowledge this.</p>

<p>And here I must specially thank my two officers
of the watch, Krapohl and Eyring, whose notes
have helped to make this account complete. It is
impossible for a commander to be always on the
conning-tower&mdash;I had almost said the "bridge"
from force of habit&mdash;and six eyes see further than
two. For it must be remembered that careful
observation is necessary, above everything, on a
submarine.</p>

<p>Indeed, a great number of the incidents related
here came to my knowledge through the observations
of my officers. Throughout the cruise they
proved true and unflagging companions, and to-day
they have also become fellow-workers with me in
writing this account of the voyage.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to them, even more than to
the English, and I trust my readers' gratitude will
likewise be extended to them when they have read
this book.</p>

THE VOYAGE<br />
OF THE "DEUTSCHLAND"</p>




<h2 class="nopagebreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="subheader">HOW WE CAME TO JOIN THE "DEUTSCHLAND" AND<br />
WHAT I THOUGHT OF HER</span></h2>


<p>How did we come to join the "Deutschland"?</p>

<p>That is a long story which I shall leave the authorities
to relate. The most important part of it,
however, will be found related at the end of this
book in the account given of our reception at the
Bremen Town Hall after the return of the "Deutschland"
from the United States.</p>

<p>To me, the idea of a submarine merchantman
that has been built for long voyages is the
tangible expression of the will of the German
people to frustrate the effects of the English blockade
of the coasts of Germany and America, and of the
entire cutting off of our lawful commercial imports.</p>

<p>The Hanseatic enterprise, the technical ingenuity
of German shipbuilding and the workmanlike
activities of one of our greatest dockyards, have
united in giving English domination on the sea the
biggest blow it has ever had since the Union Jack
fluttered over the waves.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_010" title="10"> </a>
At the same time we must not to-day overlook
the changes and developments that are bound to
follow in the construction and use of submarine
merchantmen. Thus it is possible that the
methods of sea warfare will be entirely revolutionised,
that new conceptions and conditions of international
law will be created, and that changes in
the commercial relations of the world will follow
which may influence the lives of peoples even
more strongly than the present world-war is doing.</p>

<p>We may be proud of the fact that it is a German
boat that has ushered in this new epoch.</p>

<p>Our achievement is not to be minimised by the
fact that Canadian warships have crossed the Atlantic
before us during this war. For they travelled in
company, always changing, and accompanied by
torpedo-boats, cruisers and auxiliaries. They
contained only provisions and ammunition, and
except for their armament had no dead weight to
carry. But their greatest advantage was that they
could defend themselves if necessary, whereas the
only defence of the submarine merchant-trader lies
in submerging. And that is not everywhere possible
with a huge, heavy ship of nearly 2000 tons.</p>

<p>Well, I found myself faced with the problem of
taking the "Deutschland" to America&mdash;an entirely
novel and wonderful task. It would have
been a new one to me, moreover, if I had not been
as I was, an old North German Lloyd captain
of a large clumsy steamboat, but a young U-Boat
commander.</p>

<p>But to explain this I must first relate how I came
across the "Deutschland." Events moved with
<a class="pagenum" name="page_011" title="11"> </a>
surprising rapidity in connection with it. In the
middle of October, 1915, I was in Berlin on business.
I had then been obliged to leave my bonny steamer
"Schleswig" for some time, but the North German
Lloyd Company were well acquainted with my
whereabouts.</p>

<p>One evening, whilst I was at my hotel, I received
a communication, with an urgent invitation to
visit Herr Lohmann in Bremen at the Hotel Adlon
at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>I was surprised. I knew the name of the head of
the famous Bremen firm very well, and had been
personally acquainted at one time with Herr
Lohmann in Sydney, where his firm had been agents
for the North German Lloyd Company.</p>

<p>But what did Herr Lohmann want of me, now in
these days of war when the "German merchant
fleet had been swept from off the seas," as one read
daily in the English newspapers? At that time it
would have been exceedingly difficult to undertake
the management of a German line to the Straits and
Australia! And in the Baltic Sea the firm had no
trade connections.</p>

<p>What, then, did they want with an old East Asia,
America, and Mediterranean captain? Thus I
ruminated as I made my way to the Hotel Adlon.</p>

<p>Herr Lohmann received me cordially and did not
hold me long in suspense. He alluded to the fine
old days in Sydney, asked me how I liked hanging
about on dry land, and if I would care again to
undertake a long voyage.</p>

<p>What could an old merchant captain say to this,
a man who had been practically obliged to leave
<a class="pagenum" name="page_012" title="12"> </a>
his ship in an enemy country, and lie about like a
wreck on land, while on the other side of the Channel
and off the Shetlands the cursed English cruisers
lay in wait, and four miles from New York even
the American post on neutral ships was overhauled?</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders and was silent.</p>

<p>Then it all came out.</p>

<p>Herr Lohmann told me straight away that he was
thinking of starting a line of submarine traders
to America, and asked me if I would be willing
to take command of the first boat. He explained
that the first voyage was to be to Newport-News,
and asked me, as I had a knowledge through my
voyages on the Baltimore line of the North German
Lloyd ships, of the waters and depth conditions
outside Chesapeake Bay, whether I thought I
should be equal to taking such a submarine trader
safely across the Atlantic, if the matter really came
off.</p>

<p>It was a great plan.</p>

<p>I was never one for weighing pros and cons, and
so I said "Yes" straight away. This was indeed
a chance for a fellow of over forty-five years, in this
war of "black lists" and daily postal robberies, to
do something!</p>

<p>"Herr Lohmann," I said, "if the matter really
comes off, you can count on me."</p>

<p>And the matter really did "come off."</p>

<p>Barely two months had elapsed when a telegram
called me to Bremen for an important discussion.
There I saw designs, sketches, and constructional
drawings enough to make me open my eyes wide.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_013" title="13"> </a>
And when, four months later, during which time I
had been by no means idle, I travelled to Kiel,
there rose before my eyes on the slips a strange
steel object. Trim, comfortable-looking, and quite
harmless she lay there, but nevertheless, hidden
in its interior, was the realisation of all those
detailed, overwhelmingly complicated figures and
plans.</p>

<p>I cannot say that the completed reality even then
helped to make more intelligible those blue papers
with their endless network of strokes and lines,
which had so dismayed and bewildered the mind
and eye.</p>

<p>Any of my readers who have ever seen in illustrated
papers sketches of the control-room or of the
conning-tower of a U-Boat will understand this.
Indeed, when they are face to face with such a wild
medley of rudders, valves, screws, cocks, tubes
and pipes, with such a bewildering conglomeration
of levers and apparatus, each of which has a highly
important meaning and purpose, let them take
comfort. My impressions were just the same.</p>

<p>But when this tube-like monster was christened,
and her giant grey-green body slipped majestically
and silently into the water, she was suddenly
transformed into a seafaring vessel, a vessel that
swam in her rightful element, as if she had always
done so. The first time I trod her narrow deck
and climbed into the conning-tower and on to
the navigation platform, it was only from her sides,
where the green body swelled massively out of the
water, that it was possible even faintly to realise
how enormous her hull must be.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_014" title="14"> </a>
With proud delight my eyes travelled over the
whole structure, as it swayed lightly beneath me,
delicacy and strength symbolically blended.</p>

<p>Now I knew that what had hitherto appeared to
me as a monstrous product of technical imagination,
was a ship, in which I could travel the seas&mdash;a real
ship&mdash;on which an old seaman could set his
affections.</p>

<p>Then I laid my hand on the parapet of the conning
tower of the "Deutschland" and swore to be true
to her.</p>

<p>And in this manner I struck the "Deutschland"
and became commander of the first submarine
merchant-trader.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER II<a class="pagenum" name="page_015" title="15"> </a><br />

<span class="subheader">THE TRIAL AND DEPARTURE</span></h2>


<p>And now a strange and wonderful time followed.
Day after day, out into the bays, down into the
depths. We practised in all weathers and under
all conditions.</p>

<p>Every man of the chosen crew realised the task
that lay before us. It meant acquiring the art of
managing this most delicate and complicated
vessel, the last word in bold and skilful construction.
It meant learning to know and understand that
marvellous wonder-work of modern shipbuilding&mdash;a
submarine. We had to be in a position to sway,
according to our will, this heavy mass of nearly
2000 tons, so that she should obey the least pressure
of the rudder, so that she should twist and
man&oelig;uvre like a torpedo-boat, so that she should
rise and sink in the water like a dirigible in the air.</p>

<p>It meant probing the trustworthiness of the unyielding
steel body, the weight and pliability of her
mighty machinery; getting on the track of her
imperfections or tricks, and coaxing from her the
secrets of her mobility and fantastic fish nature.</p>

<p>A submarine is as full of humours as a woman,
and as tricky as a racehorse. She is as sober
as a tramp-steamer, and as trustworthy as a tug.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_016" title="16"> </a>
She has good qualities and&mdash;not good. She can be
pliant as a racing yacht and as pig-headed as a mule.
And she only obeys him who knows her down to
her smallest technicalities.</p>

<p>In this spirit we practised for weeks, round about,
above and below water. We studied our boat, and
tried not only to become familiar with all her possibilities,
but to penetrate into the inner mysteries
of this nautical amphibian. And when we returned
from the stillness of the bay to the ear-splitting
noise of the riveting hammers and the restless hum
of the dockyard, we would sit for hours with the
constructors and exchange our experiences.</p>

<p>This practical testing gave rise to much stimulating
groundwork for new plans and inventions.</p>

<p>It is difficult to express the high esteem I feel for
the men of the dockyard at Kiel, or how much I
owe to their co-operation. They were untiringly
helpful in explaining and testing this wonderful
product of their hands and brains, in all its peculiarities.
On the very day of our departure the
ingenious constructor of the "Deutschland," Over-Engineer
Erbach, came out to our place of anchorage
to make a last submerging test.</p>

<p>And at last the day of our departure arrived.</p>

<p>The "Deutschland" was loaded up. The valuable
cargo lay well packed in its appointed place,
the whole boat was once more overhauled and
brought into careful trim.</p>

<p>We laid in provisions for the long journey, and at
the last moment even cigars and&mdash;gramophone
records were brought on board.</p>

<p>With these all our possible wants were securely
<a class="pagenum" name="page_017" title="17"> </a>
provided for, and the "Deutschland" was ready
for the voyage.</p>

<p>We were ready, too. The farewells from all our
dear ones at home lay, God be thanked, behind us;
there is always a nasty moment in connection with
a cruise into the Unknown, which it is best to get
over quickly.</p>

<p>The last to shake us by the hand were the men of
the Germania dockyard.</p>

<p>Then the gangway is pulled up, the crew take up
their stations, and I climb into the conning-tower.</p>

<p>The steam-tug lies beside us and takes over the
hawsers. I call down to the engine-room, "Look
out!" and raise my hand. The great moment has
arrived.</p>

<p>"Cast off the aft hawsers!"</p>

<p>"They're off."</p>

<p>"Tow away, 'Charlotte'!"
<a name="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The engine telegraph on the stout little steam-tug
sounds: the sturdy craft strains at the tow-ropes,
and slowly the stern of our "Deutschland"
is drawn away from her resting-place in the dock.</p>

<p>"Cast off the bow hawsers!"</p>

<p>"They are off."</p>

<p>And with a smack the last hawsers fall from the
pier wall into the black, seething waters of the
harbour.</p>

<p>Now we are off. I take up the speaking-tube to
the control-room:</p>

<p>"Port engines half-speed astern!"</p>

<p>"Starboard engines slowly forward!"</p>

<p>"Rudder twenty starboard!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_018" title="18"> </a>
"Rudder lies twenty starboard."</p>

<p>Thus the replies from the engine-room come back
promptly.</p>

<p>On the conning-tower where I stand next to the
helmsman, in front of his little hand-wheel, one
hardly feels the movement of the engines.</p>

<p>Only from the churned-up water that seethes
foaming and dirty against the rounded body of the
"Deutschland," quickly dispersed to starboard,
is it possible to realise that the engines are
working.</p>

<p>Slowly the big green whale's back twists and turns,
lies first broadside on in the fairway, then slightly
to port, then turns with the help of the tug once
more to port and astern.</p>

<p>"Stop both engines!"</p>

<p>Slowly the boat moves slightly backwards,
pulling at the tow-ropes in its backward movements
like some primeval monster. A quick glance from
the conning-tower over the trail of water and the
pier walls. We have enough room to man&oelig;uvre.
The hawsers are cast off, and then both engines
are set at half-speed with rudder to port. We turn
once more to get well clear of the dock walls where
a big grey battle cruiser is being finally equipped.
Then I let the rudder lie amidships and order both
engines "full steam ahead."</p>

<p>The stern begins to tremble in rhythmical vibration
under the increased engine-power, the churned-up
water rushes foaming from her sides&mdash;the journey
begins. Faster and faster the "Deutschland"
pushes her way through the dirty waters of the
harbour, out into the bay. Our course lies next
<a class="pagenum" name="page_019" title="19"> </a>
through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to the Weser,
where the shipment of the cargo will be completed.</p>

<p>The ship's papers and express post are brought on
board by the freighting officials in a special tug,
and without any fuss, calmly and secretly the
"Deutschland" starts on her remarkable voyage&mdash;the
first submarine of the world, to whom blockades
are unknown&mdash;out into the open sea, into the freedom
of the ocean.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER III<a class="pagenum" name="page_020" title="20"> </a><br />

<span class="subheader">THE FIRST DAY AT SEA</span></h2>


<p>The North Sea rolls in long swells against us. The
weather is clear and the wind blows sharply from
N.N.W.</p>

<p>I am standing alone with my first officer on duty
on the conning-tower, in the "bath-tub," for thus
we have nicknamed the strong shelter which is
built round the conning-tower hatch of the "Deutschland,"
and which looks like a kind of flying gondola.
In front of this is the upper steering station, which
can, however, only be made use of in fine weather.</p>

<p>To-day we stand in oilskins behind the shelter,
for the sea is already quite rough enough to wet
everything through. The deck is continually
swamped, and every minute the waves break over
the tower.</p>

<p>I listen with the speaking-tube to the control-room
in my hand, while the helmsman growls commands
through the telegraph to the engine-room. A
dull roar, the bow dips down, foaming, and the waves
rush over the deck and dash high against the conning-tower.
As quick as lightning we close the
hatches and duck in our crackling oilskins behind
the shelter ... this little game is repeated every
five minutes.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_021" title="21"> </a>
Between whiles we stand up, listening to the wind
rattling in the stays of the masts, and look around us.</p>

<p>For some time the German coast has faded from
sight behind us in the S.E., and the accompanying
torpedo-boat which travels in front of us is the
last bit of the Homeland. Soon we approach the
last line of German outposts; four look-out vessels
pass by us in single file and signal us "Pleasant
voyage."</p>

<p>Our faithful companion now approaches nearer;
her crew give us three hearty cheers; the officers
on the bridge salute; and we two lonely men on the
tower return the salute. Then the little black
boat ducks into the sea, makes a beautiful turn,
stirring up the foaming water at her keel, grows
smaller and smaller, and presently disappears,
leaving a thin drifting smoke-flag behind her.</p>

<p>We are left to ourselves, and travel into the
Unknown.</p>

<p>Not much time, however, is allowed for thinking.
Danger now threatens us from all sides, and I have
to make certain that the boat is in good trim, and
that I have the engines and submerging appliances
well in hand.</p>

<p>I give the command, "Clear everything for a
submerging test!"</p>

<p>At once the response comes back from conning-tower
and control-room, and the crew hurry to
their submerging stations. The oil engines are still
throbbing and hammering. Then the alarm bell is
sounded and I spring into the conning-tower; the
hatches are closed, and at the same time the oil
engines cease working.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_022" title="22"> </a>
For a moment one is conscious of a slight pressure
in the ears; we are shut up from outside and all is
still, but there is no real silence; only a change of
sound.</p>

<p>Then comes the command:</p>

<p>"Open the submerging valves!"</p>

<p>"Flood!"</p>

<p>What now follows is so strangely impressive that
one could never forget it, once having experienced it.
The submerging valves are quickly opened, and with
a hiss the compressed air rushes out of the tanks. A
gigantic volume of air rises, with such an unearthly
snorting and blowing that the pressure in
one's ears becomes almost painful. Then the noise
becomes more even, and is followed by a loud
humming and whistling, and all the high notes of
the machinery in the engine-room join together and
produce a confusion of sounds.</p>

<p>It is like the strains of some mad, diabolical
music that, after the dull, heavy hammering of
the oil engines, gives a momentary impression of
unearthliness that is at once penetrating and impressive.</p>

<p>This noise in the valves is a sign that the submerging
mechanism is at work.</p>

<p>The music continues, but in a long downward
scale, and during these long drawn out, ever-deepening
sounds, one has a bodily feeling as of the rushing
in and flooding of mighty masses of water. One
seems oneself to grow heavier and to sink with the
boat.</p>

<p>Through the window of the conning-tower and
by the aid of the periscope it is now possible to
<a class="pagenum" name="page_023" title="23"> </a>
observe how the front part of the boat is sinking;
the railings are cutting their foaming way through
the waves, while the water round the conning-tower
rises higher and higher, till everything outside is
wrapped in the wonderful twilight of the deep.</p>

<p>Only our faithful lamps are shining. Now it has
indeed become silent. The only sound that reaches
the ears is the soft swaying rhythm of the electric
engines.</p>

<p>Then comes the command:</p>

<p>"Go down to eleven fathoms!"</p>

<p>"Both engines half-steam ahead!"</p>

<p>By the gauge I can follow the depths we are
making. Through the flooding we have added
several tons of dead weight to the boat. We have
made the closed up ship's body heavier than the
mass of water displaced&mdash;and our giant fish sinks&mdash;almost
falls&mdash;into her element down below.</p>

<p>At the same time we are moving with the electric
engines, and the forward thrust of the propeller
brings pressure and reaction upon the diving
rudder, and transforms the sinking into a downward
gliding movement.</p>

<p>When the desired depth is reached, which I can
tell at once from the depth gauge, further sinking is
prevented by the simple means of making the boat
lighter again through pumping out the superfluous
water from the submersion tanks.</p>

<p>The furious working of the pumps is thus always
the sign that we are approaching the desired
depth. Then it stops, only the electric engines
continue humming, and from the control-room
comes the announcement:</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_024" title="24"> </a>
"We are lying at eleven fathoms."</p>

<p>"Boat is trimmed!"</p>

<p>We are travelling at a depth of eleven fathoms.
This means that we are practically blind and can
only judge our way by the depth gauge and by the
help of that carefully protected boat's treasure&mdash;the
gyro-compass.</p>

<p>No glimmer from outside now reaches us; the
periscope has long been swallowed up, and the steel
safety shutters in the windows of the conning-tower
are tightly closed. We are entirely transformed
into the character of a fish.</p>

<p>Now the communications from all compartments,
control-room, engine-room, stern-room, bow-room,
holds, accumulator rooms, come through without a
hitch. We can travel safely with our "Deutschland"
in the deeps.</p>

<p>It is not always, however, such an easy matter
to bring a boat of this size down to a prescribed
depth. The changes in the specific weight of the
water, owing to varying temperatures or to the
different proportions of salt held in solution, play
a very important rôle. How strong an influence
this can prove I will show in the difference between
the Baltic and North Sea waters.</p>

<p>The specific gravities of the two seas are in the
proportions of 1·013 to 1·025. This difference in
itself may not appear very considerable. With a
boat, however, of the size of the "Deutschland," for
the submersion of which a very heavy excess weight
of many tons is necessary, very important consequences
are bound to follow from this difference in
specific gravity. Thus in order to submerge in
<a class="pagenum" name="page_025" title="25"> </a>
the heavier waters of the North Sea it is necessary
to make the boat at least seventeen tons heavier
than in the Baltic, as otherwise we should not sink.</p>

<p>Moreover, during sudden alterations in the
temperature of the water in the bays and river
mouths, where the lighter fresh water comes in,
the most unpleasant surprises often occur.</p>

<p>Many a U-Boat commander has thought it possible
with a certain amount of excess weight to
submerge without difficulty and to keep his boat
at a fixed depth. Suddenly, however, the pressure
gauge registers a greater depth and the boat drops
in the water, like an aeroplane which has fallen into
an air-pocket, until a test of the specific weight and
temperature of the water gives the clue to her
behaviour.</p>

<p>It will therefore be seen that such measurements
are necessary before the commander can count with
certainty on being able suddenly to submerge and
as suddenly to reappear above the waters.</p>

<p>In the meantime we have finished our submerging
test satisfactorily. All has gone well and
each part fully performed its functions. We are
in complete control of our complicated apparatus.</p>

<p>Now the command to reappear is given, the diving
rudders are set to "up," and immediately I am
able by the depth gauge to follow their working
and that of our stout pumps.</p>

<p>After assuring myself that there is no noise of
propellers to be heard anywhere in our vicinity, and
that on all sides there is no likelihood of collision
with any steamer, we pass through the dangerous
"blind moment."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_026" title="26"> </a>
By this I mean that space of time during which
the boat has risen so high that she could be rammed;
while, on the other hand, she is still too deep under
the water to get the periscope above the surface
and take a look round.</p>

<p>This lasts a few minutes. I stand at the periscope
and watch. Already the field of vision is lighter.
Silvery air bubbles rise up glittering; a blinking
and twinkling appears on the glass. Then it is day.
A picture arises, clear and shining. The North Sea
sways before my eyes with an empty and endless
horizon.</p>

<p>Now we are rising to the surface. By the use of
the rudder the boat pushes forward faster and faster
to the surface of the water. In order to accelerate
the ascent compressed air is forced into one of the
submersion tanks.</p>

<p>Now she moves very rapidly: the tower is
already free. The deck rises dripping out of the
water, the conning-tower hatch is opened, fresh
air streams in, and I give the command:</p>

<p>"Blow out ballast tanks!"</p>

<p>A wild howling and screeching comes in reply
from the control-room, while the powerful turbine
engine presses the water out from the submerging
tanks.</p>

<p>This does not take long. As soon as a tank is
empty the excess air rushes out with a pleasant
sound at the side of the boat, and we are soon in
normal floating trim again.</p>

<p>We are still using electricity. Now comes last of
all the starting up of the heavy Diesel engines by
the electric motors.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_027" title="27"> </a>
I have already climbed into the conning-tower
and can see nothing of all this, except by the communications
from the control-room. Those who are
in the engine-room, however, will have an exciting
spectacle.</p>

<p>The observation engineers stand at their
posts. A command comes through the speaking-tube.
Everything is ready. Then the chief engineer
gives a shrill whistle, raises his hand, two quick
wrenches at the switchboard in the electrical engine-room,
a couple of blinding flashes half an inch long:
the first valve-heads rise slowly, hesitatingly, as if
unwilling, then quicker, a wild report and hissing,
a wild irregular spluttering, then the loud explosions
become rhythmical, and faster and faster both
machines resume their regular vibrations.</p>

<p>The submerging test is completed, and pounding
along the "Deutschland" proceeds on her way.
The wind does not drop, but the weather keeps
fine and the visibility is good.</p>

<p>No steamer comes in sight: we can remain comfortably
above water. Nevertheless we need to be
extremely careful in our navigation.</p>

<p>So the day draws to its end. But as the sun sinks,
dark threatening clouds appear, prophesying bad
weather for the following day.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV<a class="pagenum" name="page_028" title="28"> </a><br />

<span class="subheader">THE U-BOAT TRAP</span></h2>


<p>And thus it turns out. The further we get from
land, the rougher grows the sea. The boat is badly
tossed about. I notice the roughness of the sea as
I lie in my cabin, and towards two o'clock in the
morning I am awakened by a "Hullo," from the
speaking-tube on the wall at my head.</p>

<p>The watchful second officer, Eyring, announces
a white light to starboard which is approaching
rapidly.</p>

<p>I spring out, balancing myself round the
corner in the control-room, over the ladders, up
through the conning-tower hatch, on to the platform.</p>

<p>Eyring shows me at no great distance ahead a
white light. It appears to be approaching. We
decide not to let it come any nearer, and give the
alarm to submerge. Then for the first time I realise
the wonderful sense of security that the possibility
of such a rapid submersion gives.</p>

<p>It is all quite a matter of course. Here we travel
in the middle of this world-war, with an unarmed
freight vessel through darkest night. A light
approaches. It may be an enemy, it probably is.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_029" title="29"> </a>
In a few minutes a couple of shots may flash out,
several shells shatter our conning-tower, the water
stream into the ship's body, and in a short while the
North Sea close over us.</p>

<p>None of this occurs however. A brief command
in the control-room, a few grips of the valves and
hand wheels, and we continue our way unhurt, for
brutal power may shut us from the surface of the
seas, but our enemies in their impotence only cause
us to lie a few fathoms deeper. We continue submerged
for the sake of safety until daybreak.
Towards four o'clock we rise to the surface. It is
already broad daylight, but unfortunately also
there is a very troubled sea. In the distance we
see a couple of fishing-boats laboriously going about
their business. We keep them at first sharply
under inspection, but quickly discover their harmless
character and continue our way over the
water.</p>

<p>This process has long ceased to be of a pleasant
character. The movements of the boat are such
that existence down below in the closed-up compartments,
aired only by the ventilator machines,
is causing headache and sickness among the men;
part of the crew are losing their appetites. Yet it
is quite out of the question to remain on deck,
which is continuously swept by the seas.</p>

<p>It is somewhat drier on the conning-tower behind
the shelter of the "bath-tank" and on the lee side
of the tower, which is sheltered from the sea and
wind.</p>

<p>Here a few of the watch off duty are huddled
together, holding fast to the rails, inhaling the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_030" title="30"> </a>
fresh air and shaking themselves when a particularly
heavy breaker rolls up round the conning-tower
covering them in salt spray.</p>

<p>Thus we travel on the whole day.</p>

<p>A couple of steamers, whose smoke-clouds appear
in the distance, we avoid above water by
altering our course, after we have made out their
route by careful sounding and observation.</p>

<p>This sounds more difficult than it really is. You
first of all make sure of the position of your own
ship by soundings and calculations, after you have
roughly estimated the position of the unknown vessel
on the map. If the relative positions of these two
are compared on the map with the most important
steamer routes, it is possible to judge with some
certainty the course the unknown ship must
take.</p>

<p>Such a calculation was soon to prove of great
importance to us, and was in this case, as will be
seen, of great significance.</p>

<p>Towards evening it clears up slightly, and the
sea grows calmer. The sun sets under brilliantly
illuminated clouds in the west.</p>

<p>All the watch off duty have come on deck to get
some fresh air and smoke a hasty cigar or cigarette.
Below deck smoking is strictly forbidden. The
men are all huddled together on the sheltered
side of the conning-tower, tightly packed and
pressed against the wall.</p>

<p>It is a strange sight, rather like a swarm of bees,
this cluster of men in rough, heavy sea clothes.
There is not much etiquette observed here; I know
the men have no easy job down below there, and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_031" title="31"> </a>
when one of them sticks his head through the
tower hatch to draw a few puffs at his pipe, I gladly
grant him the short respite.</p>

<p>Moreover, all eyes are fixed unconsciously on
the horizon, and this is a good thing. The
more men there are to watch, the more can be
observed, and many of our crew have the eyes of
an eagle.</p>

<p>Suddenly in the clear twilight of the June
evening two masts appear in the distance on
the port side; a funnel follows, and soon the
hull of a steamer appears on the verge of the
horizon.</p>

<p>With the help of our excellent prismatic glasses
we hold her steadily under observation, our object
being to make out her course in order to steer clear
of her.</p>

<p>We have soon measured her distance, and I take
up the map, compare, reckon, look at the vessel
again, then pause bewildered.</p>

<p>From the course she is following the steamer will
never reach a port.</p>

<p>Is it possible then?</p>

<p>I call up Krapohl and point out to him my
calculations. We have another good look through
the glasses, compare maps; they agree.</p>

<p>The fellow is following no route whatever.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile we had approached near enough
to make the steamer out distinctly. The twilight of
the June evening is so clear and bright that we
can observe her with the greatest accuracy. She
is a fine steamer of medium size, and carries a
<a class="pagenum" name="page_032" title="32"> </a>
neutral flag, while her hull is painted in the colours
of her country.</p>

<p>In the middle of the hull is a long double name
which we cannot, however, read.</p>

<p>Suddenly Krapohl cries:</p>

<p>"Good heavens! how is it that she is flying her
flag so long after sunset? Is it mere chance, I wonder?
And what does that extraordinary coat of
paint on her hull signify? She is a suspicious looking
craft."</p>

<p>I am forced to agree with him.</p>

<p>The apparently aimless course of the steamer fills
me with amazement. It is not usual to take a sea-trip
on the North Sea for amusement in the middle
of this world-war!</p>

<p>We consider what is to be done. As yet the
steamer has not sighted us; she continues her
mysterious course, and by this time lies a little
astern of us.</p>

<p>I decide nevertheless not to submerge, as our
courses must soon diverge.</p>

<p>Suddenly the steamer makes a rapid turn and
comes straight towards us. Now we can see that
the sturdy neutral has swung out her boats;
obviously with intent to make more complete her
character of a peaceful merchantman, is ready
and prepared to follow all commands.</p>

<p>This remarkable civility on her part is quite
sufficient for us. I send all the crew below deck
and give the alarm at once.</p>

<p>We make ready to submerge, and in doing so
move towards the steamer in order to lie broadside
on to the sea, which makes diving easier.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_033" title="33"> </a>
Then, to our great amazement, the following
incident occurs. Hardly has the "neutral" ship
observed our movements and noticed that we
are submerging, than she twists round with a
jerk.</p>

<p>As we submerge we can still watch her as she wends
her characteristic zigzag course, puffing out thick
clouds of smoke behind her.</p>

<p>This confession of a bad conscience struck us
profoundly. Never have we laughed so heartily as
over the flight of this honest merchantman with her
unknown course.</p>

<p>The artful dodger thought she was found out, and
feared any moment we might send a torpedo into
her ribs.</p>

<p>And how furious she must have been! It would
have been so fine to approach quite near to the
"pest" in the character of neutral ship, and then
at a safe distance to let the mask of "harmlessness"
drop, and shoot through the port-holes.</p>

<p>The trap was so beautifully laid. The German
"pirate" had only to go just a little nearer. Instead
we described a curve under water, and only rose to
the surface again two hours later.</p>

<p>First I searched the horizon with the aid of the
periscope. Then I opened the hatch of the conning-tower,
which was still half submerged, in order to
get a look round with the glasses. The air was clear.
In the south the moon had risen, making the dusky
light of the summer night even more transparent.
But as far as the eye could see the sea was empty,
no steamer was in sight.</p>

<p>The "Deutschland" could continue her way
<a class="pagenum" name="page_034" title="34"> </a>
unlighted, and besides our huge delight over the
disappointment of the crafty trap-layer, I had
now the certainty that we could see all vessels before
they could see us.</p>

<p>And that was no small matter.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER V<a class="pagenum" name="page_035" title="35"> </a><br />

<span class="subheader">A SOMERSAULT IN THE NORTH SEA</span></h2>


<p>That night, during the darkest hours between
eleven and one o'clock, I had decided to travel
submerged with the electric engines.</p>

<p>When we submerged in the twilight of the long
summer night there had been very little wind, but
there was a heavy swell&mdash;a sure sign that the wind
would rise to a storm within a few hours. Towards
two o'clock I gave the order to rise to the
surface, and soon noticed from the increasingly
wild movements of the boat that the storm had
arisen, and that a rougher sea must have set in
with it.</p>

<p>At times we made regular springs, but continued
steadily blowing out from our tanks and came to
the surface in good order.</p>

<p>From the lower end of the periscope I tried to get
my bearings. It was, however, almost impossible
to see anything, as the periscope was continually
enveloped by the heavy breakers, the dim light
causing the huge waves to assume monstrous and
uncanny proportions.</p>

<p>Now we had risen entirely to the surface, and I
climbed into the conning-tower to get a proper
outlook over the wildly dancing sea. It had
<a class="pagenum" name="page_036" title="36"> </a>
become pleasant weather indeed! In the pale dim
light was visible a seething witch's cauldron of tossing,
mountainous waves crowned with foam, from
which the wind tore away the spray and hurtled it
through the air. The boat struggled heavily against
it and made little headway. The entire deck was,
of course, flooded, and every moment the sea dashed
up over the conning-tower and fell over me in
showers of spray. I clung on to the parapet of the
"bath-tank" and scanned the horizon&mdash;a strange
outlook, one continually shifting scene of mountainous
rollers.</p>

<p>I was just about to give the order to start the oil
engines working when&mdash;what is that over there?</p>

<p>That dark streak yonder&mdash;surely it is a line of
smoke?...</p>

<p>Then the back of a wave blots it out for a
moment from the pale grey sky....</p>

<p>I wait, staring through the glass till my eyes
ache....</p>

<p>There it is again, a dark line of smoke ... and
there, there: a masthead, thin as a needle, yet I
can see it through my glasses; and now ... my
eyes are boring their way through the glasses ...
that black thing over there just visible in the valley
of the waves ... the smoke above it, four low
funnels....</p>

<p>Good heavens! it is a destroyer!...</p>

<p>With one bound I spring into the conning-tower,
close the hatch:</p>

<p>"Alarm!"</p>

<p>"Submerge quickly!"...</p>

<p>"Flood the tanks!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_037" title="37"> </a>
"Diving rudder; eleven fathoms down."</p>

<p>The commands follow each other in rapid
succession. But to carry them out is a different
matter!</p>

<p>To submerge head on to this sea will be from all
experience sheer madness....</p>

<p>But what am I to do?</p>

<p>The destroyer may have seen us already....</p>

<p>Down we must go, and as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Below me, in the control-room, the crew are working
in speechless haste. The emergency air valves
are opened, the compressed air hisses out of the
tanks&mdash;the submersion valves sing in all their
scales....</p>

<p>I stand with compressed lips, looking through
the tower window over the tossing sea around me,
waiting for the first sign of sinking....</p>

<p>But still I can see our deck, still the waves toss
us up high into the air.... We have no more time
to lose.</p>

<p>I order more play to diving rudders, and give the
command, "Both engines full speed ahead!"</p>

<p>The whole boat trembles and sways under the
increased engine power, and gives a couple of
springs; she staggers and reels. Is she never going
to sink?... Then with a jerk she dips suddenly
under by the bow and disappears rapidly at an ever-increasing
angle beneath the waves.</p>

<p>The daylight which is just dawning in at the
conning-tower window disappears, the depth gauge
shows in rapid succession one&mdash;one and a half&mdash;three&mdash;five
fathoms.... But still the angle of the boat
increases.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_038" title="38"> </a>
We stagger, lean backwards, slip over, losing all
grip on the floor which is sinking forward ... I
am still just able to hold on to the eye-piece of the
periscope ... and down below in the control-room
the men are holding fast on to the hand-wheels of
the diving rudders....</p>

<p>This lasts for several terrible moments.</p>

<p>We are still wondering what on earth has happened,
when suddenly there comes a heavy blow;
we are thrown to the ground in all directions, and
everything that is not nailed securely down is
hurled around us.</p>

<p>We find ourselves in the strangest positions, look
at each other, and for a moment a deadly silence
prevails. Then the first officer, Krapohl, observes
dryly: "Well, we've got there, anyway."</p>

<p>This broke the horrible tension.</p>

<p>We had all grown pretty pale, and now we began
to try and face the situation.</p>

<p>What had happened?</p>

<p>Why this unnatural angle of the boat? And
why were the engines pounding so madly above us
that the whole boat quivered and shook?</p>

<p>Before any of us had time to think, however,
our little Klees, the steering engineer, had sprung
from his cowering position, and quick as lightning
had pulled the telegraph round to "Stop."</p>

<p>As suddenly a deep silence followed.</p>

<p>Slowly we collected our various limbs together
and considered: what had happened?</p>

<p>The boat was standing on her head, so to speak,
with her fore-part sloping downwards at an angle of
thirty-six; her bow must be touching ground while
<a class="pagenum" name="page_039" title="39"> </a>
the stern was obediently oscillating in the air above
water; the gauge meanwhile showed a depth of
about eight fathoms.</p>

<p>I took a rapid stock of our situation; it was far
from pleasant.</p>

<p>According to the map there should be here a
depth of about seventeen and a half fathoms;
judging from the almost upright position of our long
boat our stern must be projecting a considerable
way above water, making thereby an admirable
target for enemy destroyers. As long as the engines
continued working it followed that as the waves
passed over us the propeller lashing partly in the air
was increasing our power of attraction by causing
fountains of leaping water and foaming whirlpools.</p>

<p>This Klees had realised through the mad pounding
of the engines, and by his presence of mind had
removed the greatest danger.</p>

<p>All the same we had marked our resting-place
with the strangest of buoys, and expected every
moment to hear bombs crashing through the stem
of our boat as it hung high in the air above us....</p>

<p>Moments of extreme tension followed....</p>

<p>But all was still. The screws could no longer
betray us, and it was probably still too dark above
for them to be noticeable. The destroyer, moreover,
had no doubt enough to do in looking after herself
in this rough sea.</p>

<p>It will be understood, however, that we were
particularly anxious to get out of this absurd
position as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>As the boat was still quite intact and had sustained
the fearful shock without the least damage,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_040" title="40"> </a>
the rest of the programme was easy enough to carry
out.</p>

<p>The stern tanks which were not quite freed of air
were quickly flooded, and so gradually the boat
attained a slightly more normal position. Nevertheless,
she still lay far from the horizontal. She had
stuck her nose too fast in the mud for that!</p>

<p>By this time, however, we were at least entirely
under water, and could finish the rest of our work in
peace. Part of the water was forced out from the
fore ballast tanks, and for the rest we continued
trimming the boat with the tanks until the bow
became loosened from the ground. Now we began
to rise, and were immediately obliged to check her
in order to counteract the immediate pendulum-like
tendency of the over-weighted stern to descend.</p>

<p>After some time, however, the balance was readjusted
and the "Deutschland" was firmly in
hand again.</p>

<p>And now we had to consider what could have been
the cause of this sudden blunder on the part of our
otherwise gallant boat.</p>

<p>A great many circumstances must have combined
to produce it. Apart from the fact that it is only
possible in rare cases to submerge a heavy boat in a
rough sea, it is conceivable that owing to the haste
enforced on us by the destroyer the tanks had not
been quite pumped out.</p>

<p>The chief reason, however, appeared to be the
sudden dynamic working of the diving rudders;
this, in combination with full engine power and the
downward pressure of a particularly heavy sea,
forced the fateful gradient too suddenly. We
<a class="pagenum" name="page_041" title="41"> </a>
found ourselves in the position of a dirigible which
steers too low before landing, and through a sudden
downward current of air is flattened and crushed to
the ground by the double weight.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, the wonderful material of our
steel body stood the heavy blow undamaged. Only
the bottom of the North Sea may have suffered a
little indentation at Latitude X°&nbsp;N. and Longitude
Y°&nbsp;E.</p>

<p>One thing more strikes me as worth mentioning
in connection with this event.</p>

<p>When I look back in retrospect on my thoughts
as we dived at full speed through the deeps at
an angle of 36 degrees, I must confess my first
thought was for the cargo! Was the cargo safely
stored? Could it possibly shoot overboard?</p>

<p>The thought came quite instinctively, strange
though it seemed to me afterwards.</p>

<p>I could not shake myself free of the old Adam as
captain of a heavy steamer, even on board a U-Boat.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI<a class="pagenum" name="page_042" title="42"> </a><br />

<span class="subheader">OUT INTO THE OPEN</span></h2>


<p>We had had more than enough of the North Sea by
this time, and were now quite ready to get out into
the open.</p>

<p>We were quite clear as to our route, thank goodness.
Less so as to what might happen to us on
the voyage; but we were prepared by now for any
little surprises that might occur. For why travel
in a submarine if there are no difficulties to be overcome?
After all, many U-Boats had passed successfully
through the North Sea and reached the open
ocean. Moreover, they had had many dangerous
duties to carry out, while we had only to take
care not to be seen, and to slip out as quietly as
possible.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it was not only that we had
not to be seen. Our chief care was that we should
not be recognised as a U-Boat trader.</p>

<p>The peculiar character of the "Deutschland" as
a peaceful unarmed merchant trader would not have
protected us in the least from being sunk at
sight. Of that we were convinced, and how right
we were was seen in the later English and French
official declarations.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_043" title="43"> </a>
If we were once recognised as a U-Boat trader,
we should have been not only in danger every
minute, but our unhampered arrival at the American
port of our destination would be highly endangered.
We should have had a whole pack of thirsty bloodhounds
in our wake. We hoped therefore to take
the whole world by surprise by our arrival in
America, and all our ambitions were strained
towards this achievement.</p>

<p>Thus I meditated as we neared the danger
zone.</p>

<p>We moved forward therefore with great caution.
We saw a great deal in the process, were seen ourselves
extremely seldom; recognised never. During
the day we avoided several steamers by altering our
course. At night we travelled with darkened lights,
submerging when necessary.</p>

<p>The weather also favoured us. Once we sighted
an English auxiliary cruiser some distance off;
she was travelling in a definite direction with a
zigzag course. For some time we held a parallel
course with her, keeping her carefully under observation.
But owing to the high seas, which must
have made her navigation far from pleasant, we
remained unnoticed.</p>

<p>On another occasion a look-out vessel approached
us in the evening twilight; she had seen us and
hailed us with the English merchant flag to
signify harmlessness and thus mislead us for an
attack.</p>

<p>As we continued calmly on our way she moved
off in vexation. The sea was probably too rough
for her to seek further communication with us.
<a class="pagenum" name="page_044" title="44"> </a>
We were easily able to avoid other look-out vessels,
travelling at an even higher rate.</p>

<p>Later on it grew calm&mdash;and misty. We submerged
and came to rest on the bottom. We were in no
hurry, and why should we not take a little rest?</p>

<p>It was not what might be called exactly shallow
in that spot; it was, in fact, extremely deep. All
the more calm and safe a resting-place. For what
else were our excellent deep-sea lead machine, and
the wonderfully stout body of our "Deutschland"?</p>

<p>That night on the bed of the ocean at X&mdash;&mdash;
was a great relaxation for us all. We were
able once more to have a good wash and rest
without fear of being immediately awakened by a
"Hullo" from the speaking-tube.</p>

<p>But first of all we dined&mdash;a real, proper dinner.
The two gramophones played gaily, and we clinked
our glasses together, which were filled&mdash;possibly
out of compliment&mdash;with French champagne.</p>

<p>Our faithful Stucke&mdash;steward, second cook, and
servant to us all&mdash;waited on us with earnest solemnity,
just as if he were still steward in the dining-room
of the "Kronprinzessin Cäcilie." It was impossible
to imagine that he had been a prisoner in France
for nearly a year. It was as if he had always
haunted the "Deutschland" at a depth of ten
fathoms below the sea, where in our comfortable
mess-room he was continually developing fresh
arts and contrivances, and had stored away in the
miniature pantry and a couple of drawers an undreamed-of
amount of table linen and plate.</p>

<p>Next morning we go up to the surface again.
The pump rattles and growls and we climb with
<a class="pagenum" name="page_045" title="45"> </a>
several hundred gallons over normal weight, and
with the diving rudders in perfect working order, to
the surface.</p>

<p>At about eleven fathoms the boat begins to lose
her beautiful steadiness. This is first noticeable on
the gauge, afterwards by the diving rudders which
are harder to manipulate and on which the boat
often presses heavily. The higher we rise the more
powerful these movements become, so there must
be a pretty rough sea up above.</p>

<p>We rise now carefully up to periscope depth,
travel thus for a while and look around. Except
for a wide sweep of foaming waves nothing is to be
seen. The weather suits me exactly, for we can
diminish our watchfulness accordingly.</p>

<p>I now decide to rise entirely to the surface, and
fill one of the tanks with compressed air till the
conning-tower is sufficiently free. The oil engines
are started, and the ventilation machine makes
ready to take in a fresh supply of air. Hardly have
we opened the hatch of the conning-tower, however,
when a rough, watery greeting flies down into the
control-room. We are not quite ready apparently.
Another tank is blown out and the turbo-fan
set in motion till the tanks are soon quite
empty.</p>

<p>But first another little trick of seamanship has
to be brought into play.</p>

<p>In order to rise still higher we have to get her
broadside on again, for in this wild sea the long,
heavy body of the boat will not rise easily out of
the water head on.</p>

<p>Moving slowly we turn the "Deutschland"
<a class="pagenum" name="page_046" title="46"> </a>
broadside on to the sea. She rolls horribly, nearly
shaking the soul out of your body. Added to this,
the heavy cross-seas are sweeping continuously
over the boat. But she obeys the diving rudders
and slowly raises her nose out of the water. As we
rise entirely to the surface the conning-tower and
periscope sway alarmingly in the air.</p>

<p>Now comes another unpleasant moment. It is
necessary to bring the boat at slow speed again on
to her proper course.</p>

<p>Sheltering behind the thick windows of the conning-tower,
on which the spray streams down incessantly,
with arms and legs wedged firmly against
the sides, I peer around.</p>

<p>From old experience of the sea, I am waiting for
three particularly heavy waves to pass over, which
are usually followed by a low irregular one. Now
the third big wave has passed. There is a call to
the helmsman in the control-room; it works. The
bow bores her way slowly round, and we are back
on our old course again without meeting any particularly
heavy breakers.</p>

<p>It is still a pretty tough job all the same. The
storm, if anything, increases, and our journey
proceeds but slowly against the heavy sea. Added
to this, part of the crew are seasick; and the
short, backward pitches of the boat are horrible.
But as we proceed, the long steady swell of the
Atlantic Ocean becomes more marked. The short,
pitching movements gradually cease and change
into a majestic swaying.</p>

<p>In the distance we see two English cruisers returning
from their nightly reconnoitre. We lie too
<a class="pagenum" name="page_047" title="47"> </a>
low for them to notice us, and they disappear
rapidly in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Now we are free from the English outpost boats,
and steer cheerfully out into the wide open spaces
of the Atlantic.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII<a class="pagenum" name="page_048" title="48"> </a><br />

<span class="subheader">IN THE ATLANTIC</span></h2>


<p>At last we were out in the open.</p>

<p>The Atlantic did not receive us in a very friendly
manner it must be confessed.</p>

<p>We had grown used to a good deal in the last few
days, but I was anxious to spare the nerves of the
crew as much as possible, on account of the long
journey that lay before us. I decided therefore
to take a more southerly direction, in order to try
and hit on fairer weather if possible. Unfortunately
we were to be disappointed in this, as will be
seen.</p>

<p>As I glance to-day through my notes of those
first days in the Atlantic, I continually come across
remarks of this kind: "Heavy Sea," "Stiff wind
from the W.N.W., Strength 8," "Wind blowing
up for a storm," "Heavy seas rolling over the
whole boat and even over the conning-tower,"
"Boat travelling almost continuously under water,"
etc. In these few curt sentences lies the history
of the hard and nerve-racking existence of twenty-nine
men, shut up in the body of a steel fish, as
she made her way untiringly through the wild
tossing seas.</p>

<p>I know of no better opportunity of praising the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_049" title="49"> </a>
excellently thought-out construction and the perfect
seafaring qualities of our "Deutschland"
than in calling to mind those stormy days in the
Atlantic. The elements certainly did not help to
make our journey to America an easy one. The
highest possible demands were made on the body
and machinery of the boat, which had to be continually
at work day after day in order that we
might reach our destination.</p>

<p>And here I cannot help thinking with gratitude
of the dockyard and all the men whose work had
contributed to help us complete our journey by
giving this wonderful piece of sea-craft mechanism
into our hands.</p>

<p>It is easy to wax enthusiastic over a fine ship, that
delights the eye of every onlooker when in harbour
by her elegance, and extracts the admiration of
the expert and the uninitiated by her rapid movement
in smooth waters. But the real inner worth
of a ship is only to be discovered when she has
completed her test on the high seas. Then, and
only then, you learn her best qualities and gain
that real confidence in her trustworthiness and seafaring
capabilities, when the wind is blowing with
a strength 10, and the sea has a roughness 8, during
which you must go head on. And this not only for
a couple of hours, but day after day, week after week.
Only then can a ship prove what she is really worth.</p>

<p>This is particularly the case with a U-Boat in
war time. A merchantman in peace time has very
often a severe strain in holding out, but she has
always the possibility of seeking a port of refuge,
or of hailing assistance. At the worst, she can
<a class="pagenum" name="page_050" title="50"> </a>
drift a few days and wait for smoother weather.
None of this is possible with the U-Boat. To the
dangers of the sea are added the dangers from the
enemy, the cruellest and most pitiless of enemies.
No haven of refuge beckons to her, and if she were
to lie for a few minutes helpless and be discovered,
her adversaries, who would have helped a damaged
steamer in distress, would loosen the greedy bloodhounds
at her throat.</p>

<p>No one is so lonely and entirely dependent on
himself as a U-Boat captain. If he cannot absolutely
rely on his vessel, then he is lost.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that we realised how much
we owed to the Germania docks and to the chief
engineer, Erbach, the inventor of our boat. It was
his plans combined with the splendid co-operation
of the submarine builders and shipping officials that
had given birth to this wonderful seafaring vessel.
The boat which in the winter of 1915 arose on the
slips at Kiel, in so short a space of time and yet
with the precision of accurate workmanship, and
which Herr Erbach taught me to work and understand
on that memorable test voyage early in the
year, was now two months later bravely ploughing
her way through the stormy seas, carrying the fame
of German shipbuilding across the ocean.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The "Deutschland" had therefore been severely
tested, and had come through with flying colours.
For several days the weather remained the same,
with hurricane gusts lashing up the water into
crashing mountains of waves.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_051" title="51"> </a>
All the deck hatches were, of necessity, closed,
and at times even the conning-tower hatch, which
was so well sheltered by the "bath-tank," had
to be closed by the watch-officer at every onrush
of the waves.</p>

<p>It was far from pleasant in the conning-tower.
But below deck, where the men were suffering
badly from sea-sickness in the close atmosphere
and with the incessant rolling of the boat, it was a
thousand times worse. Many an experienced
seaman made his first offering to Neptune on this
occasion.</p>

<p>On the third day it grew calmer. The sea became
smoother and we were able to open the hatches in
order to air and dry the boat.</p>

<p>All the men of the off duty watch came on deck
and stretched themselves out in the sun, seeking a
much-needed relaxation.</p>

<p>Worn out and pale faced they appeared through
the hatches; and hardly had they inhaled the
fresh sea breeze before their beloved pipes were
lighted.</p>

<p>As we met very few steamers on our present
course, we set to work to give everything a good
drying. All the wet articles that could not be dried
down below were brought up into the air.</p>

<p>The whole deck was packed with beds, coverlets,
clothes, and boots. The clothes were fastened
securely to the deck rails, where they fluttered
merrily in the wind, as if from a washing line.
In between them the crew reposed in the
strangest positions, sunning themselves like lizards.
In order to increase the artificial ventilation of the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_052" title="52"> </a>
rooms by means of a draught of air, wind-sails were
hung up in all the hatches. With their jagged side
wings they looked rather like the fins of a fish, and
made the rounded green superstructure of the
"Deutschland" look like the back of a fantastic
monster whale. We must truly have presented a
strange spectacle.</p>

<p>No one was near, however, to notice it. We
sighted one steamer only, whose smoke appeared
towards evening on the horizon, and we were easily
able to steer clear of her.</p>

<p>The spirits of the crew were excellent, as was
shown by the merry warbling of the gramophone
from the men's room.</p>

<p>In our mess-room, likewise, we enlivened the time
with classical music, without which life on a U-Boat
would not bear thinking of. Moreover, the monotonous
part of our journey was now to begin.
The fine weather continued, and we met with few
encounters.</p>

<p>I find in my journal only the following notes:
"The dull period of our journey is commencing.
The boat is making her way, rolling slightly, but
bearing herself bravely. Now and then we go out
of our way to avoid a steamer. For several days
there is nothing to be seen; the gramophones play
gaily, and everyone is in the best of humours.
On the open sea we are entirely dependent on the
weather for our comfort."</p>

<p>It was, as a matter of fact, the first moment that
we had been able to breathe freely. Looking round
on all sides one became almost incorporated with
the everlasting sameness of the sea.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_053" title="53"> </a>
One day I was standing on the fore-deck. Near
me Humke, our giant boatswain, squatted in the
wooden scaffolding of the small central upper-deck
under which we had snugly stored our lifeboat.
Several lashings had been loosened during the
stormy weather, and had to be repaired.</p>

<p>I had stood there for some time, gazing westward,
my thoughts fixed on America, our destination.</p>

<p>Suddenly I took it into my head to broach the
subject to the sturdy Humke. I asked him what he
thought of our voyage to America in these days of
war. What were his impressions as to the object
of our enterprise?</p>

<p>The rascal grinned broadly and replied:</p>

<p>"Why, to earn money, of course."</p>

<p>This reply was a little too summary for my taste,
and I proceeded to explain to him the real significance
of renewing our commercial relations with
America in war time, in defiance of the English
blockade. I then proceeded to make clear to him
exactly what the blockade meant.</p>

<p>He grasped the idea quickly, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, now I understand what the English are
after."</p>

<p>I went further, and explained to him as fully as
I could the meaning and exigencies of an effective
blockade, and was surprised at the directness of his
answer, which expressed so naively and with such
confidence the feelings of the people in the simple
language of our sea-folk.</p>

<p>"Well, they won't get <i>us</i>, any'ow! And so
there ain't no sense in the English blockade, as I
can see!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_054" title="54"> </a>
In the meantime several of the watch off duty had
strolled up and gathered around to listen. There
they stood, broad-legged, on the narrow deck of our
little submarine in the middle of the Atlantic, a
handful of sturdy, unabashed German seamen.</p>

<p>"Men," I said, "you have heard now the reason
of our voyage, but I will tell you something more.
My good fellows, you have no idea what our cruise
really signifies. Our gallant 'Deutschland' is
much more than a mere U-Boat merchant-trader.
By her means we are bringing German goods to
America; goods which the commercial jealousy
and trickiness of the English have so far prevented
from reaching that country. And this not only to
injure Germany's exports, but in order to continue
their gloomy fishing over yonder they do their
utmost to harm American industry and commerce.</p>

<p>"That is all a thing of the past. We are seeing
to that. But this is not all. The appearance of
the first U-Boat trader is of far deeper significance.
Without even a gun or torpedo on board, the
'Deutschland' is revolutionising the entire methods
of navigation, overseas trade and international
rights, a revolution whose effects can hardly be
fully realised as yet.</p>

<p>"How, in these days of warfare, have our
armed U-Boats fared? We wanted to use them as
a means to prevent this barbaric starvation blockade,
which violates every right of humanity, and what
did the English do? They armed their merchantmen
and shot down every U-Boat that approached
them with the object of sinking their contraband.</p>

<p>"That is what they call 'defending themselves.'
<a class="pagenum" name="page_055" title="55"> </a>
And what is the result? We proceed to defend
our skin and our U-Boats,&mdash;knowing that in every
fishing vessel a 'Baralong' murderer lies in wait,&mdash;by
sinking the armed English merchant ships
without warning in order to save ourselves from
being rammed or fired on.</p>

<p>"Thereupon the English shriek for help, and by
reason of the existing conventions of sea warfare
they win the Americans over to their side, for under
the present laws of sea warfare there are no definite
conditions laid down for U-Boats. We wish to
maintain friendly relations with the great American
people, and therefore give in. The Government
which rewarded the 'Baralong' commanders has
triumphed apparently, and the command goes
forth: merchant ships are not to be sunk without
warning.</p>

<p>"Then our 'Deutschland' appears on the scenes,
a U-Boat and merchantman combined. Now
merchantmen must not be sunk without warning,
and, moreover, the present laws of sea warfare contain
no definite conditions for U-Boats. A U-Boat
trader, however, that must be searched before
sinking would be difficult to recognise, if still
capable of submerging. For then the swiftest
torpedo-boat is powerless.</p>

<p>"The English are caught in their own trap, for
the 'Deutschland' throws the whole one-sided
interpretation of the rules of naval warfare on
the rubbish heap. The weapon that was at first
used against us must now speak in our favour.</p>

<p>"For the matter stands thus. If merchantmen&mdash;which
can at the same time be U-Boats&mdash;may
<a class="pagenum" name="page_056" title="56"> </a>
not be sunk without warning, then according to the
laws and formalities of sea warfare the 'Deutschland'
has rendered the English blockade futile. For I
should like to see the German U-Trader that would
allow an English patrol vessel to approach near
enough to examine her!</p>

<p>"Or supposing she is not searched. Then, in
that case, merchant traders <i>can</i> be sunk without
warning&mdash;English traders likewise. And thus the
rights of warfare will be evenly balanced once more
by means of a peaceful, unarmed U-Boat trader.
And this, my men, is where the enormous significance
of our 'Deutschland' lies."</p>

<p>Thereupon I concluded my speech, which was by
far the longest I had ever made.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The fine weather still continued. The barometer
remained steady, the air was dry and clear. We were
gradually approaching the latitudes in which fine
weather is the rule at that time of the year. The
warmth of the sun's rays began to be felt, and our
thoughts turned towards refreshment.</p>

<p>This was provided us by our "wave-bath," a
discovery of the observation engineer, Herr Kiszling,
who otherwise showed no interest in anything but
his beloved engines. For these he was full of the most
touching and undeviating solicitude. Often, during
a heavy sea, when all the deck hatches were closed,
he would suddenly appear through the conning-hatch
and push hastily through into the "bath-tank,"
regardless of the exigencies of higher
navigation in process there.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_057" title="57"> </a>
When the officer on duty looked round, annoyed
at the disturbance, there was our sturdy Kiszling,
in his oldest oilskins, leaning over the side of
the dripping deck&mdash;filled with care for the welfare
of his engines, trying to get a glimpse of the
exhaust. At the same time he must see if the
ignition was working properly, if the heart-beats of
his engines were carrying out their functions, and
if the explosions were quite regular. He was
wrapped up in his beloved machinery and lived on
its rhythmical music. He noticed at once the least
irregularity in its working, and spared no trouble in
getting to the bottom of it.</p>

<p>It must have been during one of these special
tours of his, which were by no means without
danger, over the rounded slippery side-deck, that
the inspiration came to him. In brief, he opened
to us the joyful possibility of the "wave-bath."</p>

<p>In order to understand this, it is first necessary
to know the construction of the upper part of the
"Deutschland." Above the cylindrical hull, on the
sides of which are the submersion tanks and oil
bunkers, rises the outer ship, which gives the
vessel its real ship form.</p>

<p>In this upper part of the outer ship, the so-called
"outer tanks" are placed which, when the ship is
laden, are always flooded, as water and air may
penetrate to their interior by numerous openings,
holes and slits, in order that a rapid filling and
emptying may be achieved. The "outer tanks,"
therefore, have no connection with the floating
capacity of the boat; they are only the result of
the outer construction which above water does not
<a class="pagenum" name="page_058" title="58"> </a>
follow the line of the heavy hull and tanks. In
spite of their relatively unimportant functions the
"outer tanks" must, of course, be accessible from
the upper parts of the vessel. This is made possible
by large movable steel lids and by ladders on the
upper surface of the deck. Standing on the so-called
tank-deck, therefore, you have a slight elevation
to the upper deck surface. The sea water is continually
rushing into these big spaces during the
voyage. You have only to climb in through the
opened plate lids to enjoy an absolutely safe and
delightful sea-water bath.</p>

<p>We did not fail to put this into practice pretty
often, and found our bath delightful. There was
only one drawback to the business. If, for instance,
you entered the sea-water bath for the first time,
soon after the boat had risen to the surface, you
found yourself not in sea-water, but in an oil
bath!</p>

<p>The bunkers, as a matter of fact, never hold quite
tight, especially after a long strain of travelling,
and so it often happens that as the boat rises to the
surface a curious layer of oil breaks through before
she reaches the top. This layer of oil is then to be
found in the "bath tank," on the lids of the hatches
and on deck. Inside the "outer tanks" it naturally
remains on the surface of the water, for there it is
not able to mix and disperse quickly. It generally
remains there a day, sometimes longer, till the oily
water is drained off and replaced by new water
again. The unlucky man, therefore, who took a
bath during this period, emerged but little refreshed
and with a shiny nickel-coated skin. This metamorphosis,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_059" title="59"> </a>
as can be imagined, caused great amusement
among the crew.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The fine weather now was very favourable for
submerging tests, which were made practically every
day. Everything worked perfectly smoothly, and
we felt we could safely approach the American
coast and submerge within the three-mile zone.</p>

<p>During one of these submerging tests a wonderful
and fairy-like spectacle was presented to us. I had
caused the boat to be steered so that the conning-tower
lay nearly two fathoms under water. Above,
the sun shone brightly and filled the deeps with
radiant light. The water was lit by many colours.
Around us the sea was of brightest azure blue of an
almost dazzling clearness, and transparent as glass.
From the window of the conning-tower I could see
the whole length of the boat, round which rose
twinkling air bubbles, like pearls. In strange,
fantastic distinctness the deck lay stretched out
before me, even the furthest bow end was visible.
Further ahead was a dim-coloured twilight. It
seemed as if the bow of the boat was gliding silently
through a wall of opal green, which opened up as
she moved, and broke into a dazzling radiant-coloured
transparency of light.</p>

<p>We were spellbound at this wonderful sight, and
the strangeness of the effect was increased by the
jelly-fish as they floated through the transparent
blue and were caught in the wires of the deck
rails, where they shimmered first rose colour, then
pale yellow, changing slowly to purple.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_060" title="60"> </a>
We were not able at that slight depth to observe
any fish.</p>

<p>The next day a little incident occurred which
afforded us much amusement, though it turned out
rather differently from what we had expected.</p>

<p>My ambition was to follow in the tracks of my
comrades of the merchant service and the navy,
who had disguised their ships from the enemy by
painting and clever alterations in their outward
structure.</p>

<p>During the previous fine spell of weather we had
made a wonderful trap for steamers, in order to
disguise our identity as a U-Boat from ships passing
in the distance. We had rigged up a funnel out of
some sail-cloth, which could be fixed to the periscope
with several wire rings, till it rose proudly in the
air.</p>

<p>The conning-tower was also provided with a
covering of sail-cloth to make it resemble the upper
middle deck of a small trading vessel.</p>

<p>Thus, ready for all emergencies, we travelled on
in the brilliant sunshine, till at 7.30 in the evening
a steamer appeared in the distance to starboard.
We soon realised that she must pass quite near to
us if we continued on our present course. We
held aloof from her therefore and proceeded to try
the effects of our disguise.</p>

<p>The "funnel" is fixed up on to the periscope
and rises proudly erect in the wind. In order to
give it a more realistic appearance we burn some
cotton waste steeped in oil at its base. Then the
conning-tower disappears under the rather flattering
"middle deck."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_061" title="61"> </a>
But the disobliging cotton-wool only smoulders
horribly and refuses to give out any smoke. Everyone
stands round puffing out their cheeks, but in
vain, till the wireless operator, a shrewd Berliner,
fetches an air-pump, which produces a powerful
glow in our imaginary boiler. A cheer greets his
handiwork, and sure enough from the upper edge
of the "funnel" a delicate cloud of smoke appears,
only to vanish immediately into thin air!</p>

<p>Laughing, we decide to continue on our way
smokeless, when up comes the boatswain, Humke,
with a jam-pot full of tar. The air-pump is
again brought into play, and at last our funnel can
really be said to smoke!</p>

<p>The effect is certainly startling. For the steamer
suddenly alters her course and bears straight down
on us!</p>

<p>This is not exactly our intention. The masts
are immediately hauled down and everything
cleared for submerging; the middle deck disappears,
and with a deep bow our beautiful funnel
falls together in a heap.</p>

<p>No sooner does the steamer observe this than
she is seized with wild amazement and horror. She
turns round again abruptly and seeks flight, puffing
out thick black clouds of smoke which we eye not
without a certain feeling of envy.</p>

<p>Once more we raise our indefatigable funnel.
The masts are lifted high, and while the steamer
hastens away in wildest flight we stand and laugh
till the tears come.</p>

<p>The situation was really humorous beyond
description.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_062" title="62"> </a>
Our beautiful disguise, which was to screen us
from observation, had been the very means of
bringing the gallant steamer's attention to bear
upon us. She obviously took us for a wreck, or
some ship in distress, and approached probably
with the best intentions, to find herself face to face
with the devilish tricks of one of those rascally
submarines.</p>

<p>What must the people on board have thought
when they had recovered from the first effects of
the shock? Undoubtedly they would pride themselves
greatly on having escaped so cleverly this
new piece of "piratical" cunning.</p>

<p>And we should have been so proud if our disguise
had only worked a little better! We were not discouraged,
however, but set to work to improve on
our invention, with the result that two days later
we steamed by an approaching vessel unrecognised
under our own powerful smoke!</p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII<a class="pagenum" name="page_063" title="63"> </a><br />

<span class="subheader">THE INFERNO</span></h2>


<p>June comes gradually to an end, and with it unfortunately
the fine weather. A rising swell from the
S.W. and the absence of the current which we had
expected to help us along indicates a storm centre
in the south, diverting the course of the Gulf
Stream. Thus we travel on throughout another
day. Towards evening the atmosphere becomes
close and heavy and the sun sinks slowly in a misty
blood-red veil.</p>

<p>The sky grows threatening and overcast; there
is brilliant sheet lightning, while the ever-increasing
closeness of the atmosphere announces the near
vicinity of the Gulf Stream. During the night
masses of heavy thunder-clouds roll up, the wind
rises on every side, and the wildness of the running
seas increases, till steering becomes noticeably
difficult.</p>

<p>Measurements record an increase in the water
temperature, which finally rises up to 82½ degrees
Fahrenheit. Now we are in the Gulf Stream,
whose periphery is marked in the air above by a
fiery crown of heavy tropical thunder-clouds.</p>

<p>Vivid sea phosphorescence and strong atmospherical
disturbances are also accompanying signs
<a class="pagenum" name="page_064" title="64"> </a>
of the presence of the Stream. This is noticeable
from our wireless apparatus, which is strongly
affected by the heavy electrical conditions of the
atmosphere. Hitherto it has kept us faithfully
in touch with the army bulletins from the Nauen
station.</p>

<p>The phosphorescence of the waters makes observation
very difficult. One's eyes are blinded and
observation made difficult by the continuous
sparkling of the surface of the sea in the blackness
of the night. This state of things is far from pleasant,
for we are now approaching a zone where
many steamer tracks cross each other, and double
precautions are necessary.</p>

<p>Added to this, the foulness of the weather increases.
Heavy seas spring up, and a storm of hail
beats down on the deck. Over the foaming whipped-up
waves a wind of strength 11 to 12 is blowing.</p>

<p>All around over the boiling sea hang heavy
black balls of clouds, from which a pale yellow light
darts out incessantly&mdash;regular broadsides of lightning.
Then suddenly all is enveloped in blackest
night again, while at times the whole boat and the
surrounding water are lit up by flashes of greenish
light, in which every detail shows up with startling
distinctness....</p>

<p>The whole air is filled with tumultuous uproar,
and overhead the thunder crashes continuously.
We are approaching the centre of the storm. The
boat is surrounded by an unearthly storm-world.
It is as if the end of all things had come....</p>

<p>Suddenly the head-lights of a big steamer rise up
behind us. In the darkness of the night we are able
<a class="pagenum" name="page_065" title="65"> </a>
to avoid her without difficulty. Like a shining
vision she disappears in the distance. She is a
passenger steamer who, judging by her course, has
come from the Mediterranean. I must confess we
watched her row of lights with a feeling of envy,
till rain and darkness swallowed her up from sight
again.</p>

<p>The next day the weather reaches its worst stage.
Hurricane-like gusts of wind sweep all around. The
air is filled with continuous froth. The water no
longer falls in drops, but in cascades&mdash;walls of water
pour down, lashing our faces and hands painfully.
The air is so thick that one can no longer see through
it. In order to observe anything ever so faintly, a
small piece of glass has to be held in front of the
eyes, with the result that a little foaming torrent
rolls from the pane on to your sleeves.</p>

<p>The boat travels with extreme difficulty in the
roaring sea. She is tossed here and there by the
waves till every joint creaks and groans. Sometimes
she heels over so heavily that it is almost
impossible to hold on with one free hand only, to
the parapet of the "bath-tank."</p>

<p>It is an Inferno.</p>

<p>But this is nothing to the hell down below,
particularly in the engine room.</p>

<p>Owing to the heavy seas all the hatches are of
necessity closed; even the conning-tower hatch
can only be opened occasionally. Two great ventilation
machines are working unceasingly, it is
true. But the fresh air that they draw from the
ventilation shaft, which is carefully protected from
the breakers, is immediately swallowed up by the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_066" title="66"> </a>
greedy Diesel engines. These hungry, ungrateful
monsters only give off heat in return, heavy overbearing
heat impregnated with horrible oil vapour,
which is then swept by the ventilators throughout
all the other compartments. Such ventilation can
no longer be of a refreshing nature.</p>

<p>The air in the boat on this account has become
overwhelmingly laden with moisture. It is almost
an impossibility to breathe, and one awaits with
resignation, or desperate gaiety, the moment when
one really will be forced to join the fishes. In the
closed-up body of the ship every object is covered
in steaming water which again evaporates in the
heat, till everything is soaked through and streaming.
All the drawers and cupboard doors swell and stick
fast, and added to this the wet clothes from the
watchers in the conning-tower are spread out over
the whole boat.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give any idea of the state of
the temperature that then reigned in the boat.
In the Gulf Stream the outside temperature was
82 degrees Fahrenheit, so extraordinarily warm was
the water around us. Fresh air no longer penetrated,
and in the engine-room the two six-cylinder combustion
engines hammered on in ceaseless rhythm....
A choking cloud of heat and oil vapour issued
from the engines and spread through every part of
the boat.</p>

<p>The temperature rose gradually in these days to
127 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>And in such an inferno men lived and worked.
Groaning, the naked off-duty watch rolled about in
their cabins. Sleep was out of the question. When
<a class="pagenum" name="page_067" title="67"> </a>
one of them was just dropping off into a heavy
stupor he would be awakened to fresh misery by the
perspiration running in drops from his forehead
into his eyes.</p>

<p>It was almost a relief when the eight hours' rest
was over and the watchmen were called once more
into the control-room or the engine-room.</p>

<p>Then the martyrdom recommenced. Clad only
in shirt and trousers the men stood at their posts,
a cloth wrapped round their foreheads to keep the
perspiration out of their eyes. The blood glowed
and rushed in their temples&mdash;fever was in their veins.
It was only by the greatest strength of will that they
were able to force their streaming bodies to perform
their allotted duties, and to keep going during the
four hours' watch.</p>

<p>But how long could this state of things be expected
to last?</p>

<p>During these days I kept no journal, and can only
find the following note: "If the temperature rises
any higher the men in the engine-room will not be
able to stand it any longer."</p>

<p>They did stand it, however,&mdash;they kept going like
heroes, doing their work in spite of exhaustion, till
at last the storm centre lay behind us, the weather
cleared up, the sun broke through the clouds, and
the dropping of the sea made it possible to open the
hatches once more.</p>

<p>Then they climbed up out of their inferno, pale,
covered with dirt and oil, and rejoiced in the sun as
if they had never seen it before.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX<a class="pagenum" name="page_068" title="68"> </a><br />

<span class="subheader">AMERICA</span></h2>


<p>While crossing the Atlantic we had avoided
approaching steamers by slightly altering our
course. We had even risked being noticed on one
or two occasions, but during the last days of our
voyage we submerged directly a cloud of smoke
appeared on the horizon. On no account must we
be observed when approaching the coast, as we had
to reckon with the presence of enemy warships.</p>

<p>On the 8th July we guessed by the colour of the
water that we could not be far from our goal.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon I conferred with
my officers as to the navigation of Cape Henry,
the southernmost of the two headlands which form
the entrance to the roadstead of Hampton Road
and Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>My idea was to await daybreak at about ten
knots out from the American territorial waters in
order to discover whether any enemy measures had
been taken. If by any chance news of our voyage
had leaked out, we should certainly have to reckon
with such enemy influences.</p>

<p>Krapohl, on the other hand, was for getting in as
near the coast as possible under cover of the night,
and Eyring was of the same opinion.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_069" title="69"> </a>
Both plans had their fors and againsts, and
eventually I decided to continue our way carefully
in the twilight, and wait to see what the weather
conditions would be.</p>

<p>No sooner was our decision made than a stiff
breeze from the south-west sprang up which cleared
our range of vision considerably. At the same time,
however, the boat started rolling in a very disagreeable
manner, in the stiff, choppy sea that had
risen with the breeze. We decided, therefore,
to follow the direction of the lights on Cape Henry
and Cape Charles through the night.</p>

<p>We proceeded on our course, till not long after a
pale light flashed out suddenly on the horizon, then
disappeared again.</p>

<p>This was the glow of the flashlights on Cape
Henry&mdash;the first greeting from America.</p>

<p>Suddenly a white light shone out in the distance
to starboard, disappeared, and then flared out
again. It was immediately succeeded by a white
light on our port side, which, however, continued to
shine steadily.</p>

<p>We looked at each other.</p>

<p>What the blazes did this mean? It looked uncommonly
like darkened warships making flashlight
signals to each other. In any case, it meant a
devilish sharp look-out on our part.</p>

<p>At half-speed, submerged up to the conning-tower,
every man at his station, we crept nearer, maintaining
the closest observation, our glasses boring their
way through the darkness.</p>

<p>It was not long before we discovered that the
steady light proceeded from a harmless outgoing
<a class="pagenum" name="page_070" title="70"> </a>
steamer, which was already hurrying away at some
distance behind us. Soon after we were able to
make out from the place whence the flickering light
had appeared, the outlines of the sail of a three-masted
schooner, which like many coast steamers
was travelling without side-lights, and only showing
a white light at her stern from time to time. This
was what we had taken for the signalling of warships.</p>

<p>Much relieved, I let the engines go full speed
ahead, and soon we hove in full sight of the steady
flare from Cape Henry, while the quivering lights
of Cape Charles grew clearer and clearer on the
horizon. Now we knew that we had steered correctly.
The entrance between the two headlands
lay before us.</p>

<p>The lights were now plainly visible. With an indescribable
feeling in my heart I greeted the flare
from Cape Charles, which shone out in the surrounding
darkness a silent but sure sign that over
yonder, after our long and dangerous journey, was
firm land again, that over yonder lay our goal&mdash;mighty
America.</p>

<p>We passed now by the various light buoys of the
roadstead, and the familiar ringing of the siren buoy
near by, which I had heard on former voyages,
assured my ears as well as my eyes that we were
near terra firma.</p>

<p>After we had passed the bell buoy we rose fully
to the surface. The lights of several passenger
steamers were visible, but they did not discover us
as we were travelling with darkened lights. At
last we reached the territorial waters off Cape
Henry.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_071" title="71"> </a>
This was on the 8th July at 11.30&nbsp;p.m.</p>

<p>Once inside the territorial waters we started our
lights and proceeded steadily on our way through
the roadstead between the capes, till we made out
the red and white head-lights of a pilot steamer
ahead of us.</p>

<p>We stopped and showed the customary blue
light, whereupon the pilot steamer brought her
searchlight to bear upon us, and not recognising
the outlines of a steamer, approached cautiously.</p>

<p>She held us for some time under her searchlight,
whose rays played continuously over the low deck
and conning-tower of the "Deutschland." The
unexpected appearance of our boat seemed so to have
bewildered the gallant captain, that it was some time
before he called out to us through the speaking
trumpet: "Where are you bound for?"</p>

<p>On our replying "Newport News," he asked
the name of our ship. We gave the name, but it
was necessary to repeat it twice before he grasped
the real nature of this strange visitor. Thereupon
there must have been a great sensation on board
the pilot steamer.</p>

<p>Then a boat approached us swiftly, and the pilot
climbed up the rounded hull of the "Deutschland"
on to her deck and greeted us with the following
hearty words:</p>

<p>"I'll be damned; so here she is!"</p>

<p>Then he shook hands heartily with us again and
expressed his pleasure at being the first American to
welcome the "Deutschland" to the land of liberty.</p>

<p>I asked him immediately if he had had any idea
that we were expected. To my surprise and delight,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_072" title="72"> </a>
I learnt that for the last few days a tug had been
awaiting our arrival between the capes.</p>

<p>We started off therefore with our trusty pilot in
search of her.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the incoming steamers had
discovered the nature of this curious new arrival,
and lit us up on all sides with their searchlights.</p>

<p>Thus our arrival in American waters was rather
in the nature of a weird nocturne.</p>

<p>The search for our tug-boat was, however, by no
means an easy matter in the darkness. We cruised
around for some time till at last, after two hours,
we found her.</p>

<p>It was the tug "Timmins," under the command
of Captain Hinsch of the North German Lloyd.</p>

<p>Great was his delight, for the gallant captain,
whose steamer, the "Neckar," had lain at Baltimore
since the beginning of the war, had been
waiting nearly ten days for us between the capes.
Our long delay had filled him with distress as to our
possible fate.</p>

<p>Now, however, he was delighted to see his long-expected
protégé safe and sound before his eyes.
He communicated to us thereupon the order to
proceed to Baltimore instead of Newport News,
where everything was already prepared for our
arrival.</p>

<p>We parted therefore from our honest pilot, and
travelled on, accompanied by the "Timmins," into
Chesapeake Bay, after proudly hoisting the German
flag which had not fluttered over these waters
since the arrival of the "Eitel Friedrich" in front
of Hampton Road.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_073" title="73"> </a>
In this manner we entered the bay in the grey
morning light. Our course became by degrees a
triumphal procession. All the American and
neutral steamers that met us greeted us with prolonged
tootings from pipes and sirens. One English
steamer only passed by us in poisonous silence,
while our black, white and red flag fluttered proudly
in the wind before her eyes.</p>

<p>Captain Hinsch, moreover, in his tug, took
devilish care that the Englishman should not by
chance run too close in by the rudder and ram us
by mistake!</p>

<p>The gallant "Timmins" was useful to us in other
ways. Our only means of responding to the greetings
of the various steamers was by driving the
siren by means of our precious compressed air.
This would have gradually become an expensive
game, and so the "Timmins" undertook to return
thanks for us with her hoarse steam whistle.</p>

<p>The further we advanced into the bay the wilder
grew the noise. We rejoiced from the depths of
our hearts at these signs of sympathy with us and
our cruise on the part of the Americans.</p>

<p>Towards four o'clock in the afternoon the "Timmins"
was able to come up alongside and handed
up to us&mdash;a block of ice! A couple of bottles of
champagne were quickly cooled, and proudly we
toasted the successful arrival of the "Deutschland"
in America, our one regret in connection with this
performance being that our faithful Hinsch only
came in for the corks which flew on board the tug.</p>

<p>Only those who can realise what it means to have
lived day after day in a temperature of 127½ degrees
<a class="pagenum" name="page_074" title="74"> </a>
Fahrenheit will fully appreciate the joy of that first
cool iced drink.</p>

<p>The news of our arrival must have spread with
extraordinary rapidity, for to our no small surprise,
hours before we reached Baltimore, boats came out
to meet us with reporters and cinematograph
operators on board.</p>

<p>Although it was growing dusk we were fairly
bombarded, and we should probably have had to
run the gauntlet of a still greater stream of questions
and calls if the weather-god of Chesapeake
Bay had not come hospitably to the rescue and
ensured us a little breathing space. A heavy storm
arose suddenly, and the stream of questions was
quenched by a stream of rain which fell refreshingly
down upon us sunburnt seafarers. Meanwhile
through the fast approaching evening the
"Deutschland," accompanied by the faithful
"Timmins," travelled on once more silent and
lonely towards her goal.</p>

<p>At 11&nbsp;p.m. we drew in to the Baltimore quarantine
station, and for the first time our anchor
struck American ground.</p>

<p>The "U&nbsp;Deutschland" had arrived.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER X<a class="pagenum" name="page_075" title="75"> </a><br />

<span class="subheader">BALTIMORE</span></h2>


<p>Our first glance the following morning fell on the
stout little "Timmins," who had moored up alongside.
There she lay, the faithful soul&mdash;and mounted
guard over us.</p>

<p>Shortly after, at five o'clock, the doctor of the
quarantine station came along. I gave him up our
health certificate, which had been carefully made
out for us on 13th June by Mr. William Thomas Fee,
the American Consul at Bremen. The doctor then
examined the boat, and after mustering the crew
set us free, and ended up by giving three cheers for
the "Deutschland" and her crew.</p>

<p>The anchor was hauled up, and we travelled
under the guidance of "Timmins" towards our
wharf and resting-place at Locust Point.</p>

<p>Never before, surely, has a boat travelled under
such conditions as now fell to our lot, guarded
jealously by our "Timmins" and surrounded by a
crowd of boats specially hired by the various film
companies. On each boat five or six men stood
ready with their cameras, and tried to rouse us to
suitable cinematograph poses by chaffing remarks.</p>

<p>"Show your face, Cap!"</p>

<p>"Turn your head round!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_076" title="76"> </a>
"Wave your hand!" These and similar cries
arose on every side, while the fellows pushed and
shoved and shouted like madmen.</p>

<p>I stood in the conning-tower and looked to right
and left, waved both hands, and had no need to
force a laugh, for the wild movements of the film
hunters were indescribably funny.</p>

<p>Thus in the merriest of moods we reached our
resting-place at Locust Point.</p>

<p>Here our Captain Hinsch had spent weeks in
making all ready for us. The "Deutschland"
found such a safe harbour, and was so protected
by booms and netting from the approach of any
strange vessel, that according to all human calculations
nothing could possibly happen to her.</p>

<p>We lay inside a wooden pier built out into the
stream, under cover of a great shed, in which our
destined cargo was already piled up in waiting for
us. The situation lay so apart that the connection
of the pier with the nearest good road must be first
explained.</p>

<p>The whole position was shut off from the land
by a big trench and a steel wire fencing. In the
stream itself the "Deutschland" was protected
by the pier and the North German Lloyd steamer
"Neckar," which had lain at Baltimore since the
beginning of the war and now served us as a place
of residence, from which we could watch over our
boat.</p>

<p>On the other side, surrounding the "Deutschland,"
a regular network of heavy beams stretched out,
with thick nets which reached to the bottom of
the water, so that it would be impossible even for a
<a class="pagenum" name="page_077" title="77"> </a>
diver to get at the boat. Moreover, day and night
patrol-boats guarded the spot, among them the
"Timmins," which lit up the surrounding neighbourhood
with her little searchlight all night long.</p>

<p>Many amusing incidents occurred in connection
with this.</p>

<p>In order that the unloading and reloading of the
"Deutschland" should proceed without observation,
yet another high palisading had been erected
round the warehouse sheds which prohibited the
least view of the ship and loading place.</p>

<p>The only spot from which a glimpse of the
wonderful boat, even at some distance, could be
obtained, was from a pile-driver which was
anchored in the stream, and which was immediately
besieged by newspaper reporters as a place of
observation. Here they nested, holding us well in
sight, and keeping watch with the utmost regularity.
Day and night two men sat there continuously,
perched high on the slender scaffolding
of the pile-driver, in sacrificial practice of their
calling!</p>

<p>We were also at our posts. And at night, during
the change of watch yonder on the pile-driver, the
searchlight operator of the "Timmins" had his bit
of fun by enveloping the reporters in beams of light
and thus politely "lightening their darkness" and
assisting them in their difficult task. As they climbed
cautiously down from the scaffolding they were each
singled out by a beam of light, one after the other,
like spiders with a pocket lamp.</p>

<p>For the rest the gallant Captain Hinsch had seen
to everything, from our reception and safe guidance
<a class="pagenum" name="page_078" title="78"> </a>
down to the provision for our wants on board the
"Neckar."</p>

<p>From this steamer only a favoured few were
allowed a sight of the "Deutschland," and that only
from the outside. A visit to the boat was strictly
forbidden.</p>

<p>For her own sake we should have been glad and
proud to show our wonderful boat to everyone.
For fear, however, of the risk of an attack, which
might easily arise on the German U-Boat trader
if everyone had been allowed an inspection, we
dared not depart from our instructions in this respect.
And thus hundreds of Americans who had come
great distances, even from the west, in their motorcars,
were obliged, much to our regret, to depart
without having achieved their object.</p>

<p>The cinematograph companies, however, did not
go away entirely empty-handed. I granted their
wish to immortalise the crew of the "Deutschland"
on her first touching on American soil, and all
of us were photographed in a group on deck.</p>

<p>My first journey through the town resembled a
triumphal entry. The car was obliged to pull up
continually. Everyone tried to shake me by the
hand and pour out their congratulations.</p>

<p>During the first few days in Baltimore I became
simply an obstruction to the traffic.</p>

<p>In this manner we proceeded slowly to the North
German Lloyd agency, which was surrounded by
crowds of people.</p>

<p>The next step was to go through the necessary
Custom House formalities. I made my way therefore
to the Customs House authorities, and got
<a class="pagenum" name="page_079" title="79"> </a>
through the usual examination; I was received
on all sides in the most hearty and friendly manner.</p>

<p>Then I went back to the agency and devoted all
my sailor-like abilities to the Press. I stood in the
office of the North German Lloyd agency behind
the barrier of the booking bureau, on the other side
of which a huge crowd was pressing. I was quite
alone, and had to hold my own against hundreds
of men and women, who each had some particular
question to put, from the most insignificant personalities
up to the highest region of politics.</p>

<p>One lady called out:</p>

<p>"Do tell me, Captain, what it is like in a submarine?"
Another asked with deep sympathy,
"I say, is it true that in Germany the babies are
starving for want of milk?" While a gentleman of
extremely well-fed appearance showed his interest
by the question, "Say, Captain, what do you live
on?"</p>

<p>I was also frequently asked: "What about the
Emperor's message you've brought over for Mr.
Wilson?" To which I could give as little information
as to the question, "When do you think of
leaving Baltimore again?"</p>

<p>To all these and a hundred other questions I
was obliged to make answer. I stood there like a
breakwater, the tide swirling round me, creeping
higher and higher, till my conscious self was
almost swallowed up, only on the following day to
reappear in bits in endless Press notices all over the
world.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my body proceeded, somewhat fatigued,
to the German club, where we had been invited to
<a class="pagenum" name="page_080" title="80"> </a>
celebrate our arrival at a purely German gathering,
during which our thoughts flew back with pride and
love to the struggling Fatherland over yonder.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The following days were in the nature of a continuous
festivity for us. Only those who know
American hospitality and enthusiasm can form
any idea of the cordiality that greeted us on all
sides.</p>

<p>The people went quite mad over us, and it did
one's heart good to see what genuine sympathy
all the Americans showed over our journey and safe
arrival, and to hear how warmly they expressed
their feelings on the subject.</p>

<p>Everywhere we went we were enthusiastically
received. They shook us by the hand, sang the
"Watch on the Rhine," and expressed their appreciation
by eloquent ovations. Invitations rained
down on officers and men, parties and feasts were
held in our honour, and on one occasion, when my
two officers of the watch, who were walking with a
friend in some public gardens, became recognised,
the concert music suddenly stopped, a searchlight was
flashed on to them, and amidst general acclamation
the band struck up the "Watch on the Rhine" and
the American National Anthem.</p>

<p>While the general public of all ranks and classes
thus showed their appreciation, the American
Government were dealing with the official side of
the question as to whether our boat was to be
regarded as a merchantman pure and simple, or
whether, in accordance with the urgent protests of
<a class="pagenum" name="page_081" title="81"> </a>
the English and French ambassadors, she would,
in her character of submarine alone, be regarded as
a war vessel.</p>

<p>On the 12th July a Government Commission, consisting
of three American marine officers, came from
Washington to inspect our "Deutschland" thoroughly.
As there was no sign of armament, or
arrangements for bringing any such on board, we
were quite ready to show them over everything.</p>

<p>After a three hours' inspection, during which
every compartment and corner were examined, and
which cost the Commission officers many a drop of
perspiration during the crawling around in the
glowing heat of the boat, the Commission confirmed
the purely mercantile character of the "U&nbsp;Deutschland."</p>

<p>They were at no pains to conceal their admiration
for the ingenious construction of the whole boat,
and expressed particularly the staggering impression
of bewilderment which the complicated mechanism
of all the works had made upon them.</p>

<p>In honour of the whole crew a German festival
was started by the many German-Americans of
Baltimore, in aid of the Red Cross. This was
celebrated in Canstätter Park, a great public park
near Baltimore, with shooting galleries, sausage
stalls, open stage, dancing ground, and other forms
of amusement in the open air. I must say our
men stood this test on land as well as they had that
on the water. They acquitted themselves bravely
throughout this homage and were not awkward.
When dancing began they chose their partners
without hesitation, and a couple of smart fellows
<a class="pagenum" name="page_082" title="82"> </a>
even danced with the ladies who had got up the
fête, as if they had been used to it all their lives.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>On the 20th July the "Deutschland" received a
visit from the German ambassador, Count Bernstorff,
who had come with several gentlemen
from the summer residence of the embassy to
Baltimore.</p>

<p>We showed them over our gallant boat with
pride, although an inspection in the midst of the
embarkation of her cargo and in the intense heat
was by no means an entirely delightful one.</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day, there was an
official dinner given by the Mayor of Baltimore, in
honour of the visit of the German embassy,
preceded by a small luncheon party at the Germania
Club House.</p>

<p>The dinner given by the mayor&mdash;a most amiable
man&mdash;was of an exclusively political character,
and was only attended by politicians and officials.
There was a long succession of excellent courses
and wines, and according to American custom,
with the appearance of the endless drinks at the
close of it, many speeches were made in which
the arrival of the "Deutschland" in America, and
its importance in connection with Baltimore and
German-American friendship, were celebrated.</p>

<p>Then the municipal band appeared in the town
gardens and played the "Watch on the Rhine"
and the American hymn, while the German and
American flags were crossed.</p>

<p>This was a pleasing symbol of friendship and
<a class="pagenum" name="page_083" title="83"> </a>
understanding between the two peoples whose
interests both lay in the freedom of the seas.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>While all these festivities were in progress, which
took up nearly all our evenings, the unloading of
our boat had been completed, and the embarkation
begun.</p>

<p>This was quite a special chapter in itself. Messrs.
P.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;L. and H.&nbsp;G. Hilken, the representatives of
the North German Lloyd at Baltimore, had done
everything in their power to make this extremely
delicate part of our task as easy and safe as possible
for us.</p>

<p>They had not only acquired, on the quiet, all the
goods for our return cargo, and had them taken
to the sheds ready for loading&mdash;it was a jolly fine
stock, too, and many who saw it wondered how on
earth such a quantity of goods could ever be stored
away on a U-Boat&mdash;but they had even procured the
necessary and specially adapted loading and stocking
personnel&mdash;gangs of lightermen and dockers.</p>

<p>Much of the work on the boat and wharf was
undertaken by niggers, who were closely watched
for the least sign of observation powers or other
dangerous faculties. Moreover, the niggers were
closely searched each time before they commenced
work, and obliged to strip entirely, in order
to secure the boat against any attack.</p>

<p>The unloading was completed without any
further difficulties.</p>

<p>The embarkation, however, was a more difficult
matter. For this careful calculations on the part
<a class="pagenum" name="page_084" title="84"> </a>
of our expert submarine embarkation specialist,
shipping engineer, Prusse, of the Germania dock,
were first necessary. Every pound of the varying
weights and sizes of the goods to be loaded had
to be reckoned up before being stowed in the
space particularly appointed for them, in order
to prevent an unequal trimming of the boat.</p>

<p>An absolutely exact storing was necessary,
inasmuch as the whole loading space was very
limited, and every box and sack must be held
firmly in its position. Otherwise the most unpleasant
occurrences might arise, either during a
storm, by sudden submersions at a steep angle, or
any other incidents, which might seriously impede
our navigation.</p>

<p>An embarkation of this kind therefore was bound
to be a lengthy affair.</p>

<p>The whole cargo, sacks and boxes, had to be
carried by hand by the niggers through the narrow
hatchways. The goods had first to be weighed,
piece by piece, each separately&mdash;the weighing-inspector
taking notes meanwhile and calling out
the number of weights, which were then carefully
indexed.</p>

<p>This indexing was part of a specially thought-out
plan, according to which the whole packing was
exactly carried out, and the accuracy of this plan
was then tested by a submersion and boat-trimming
test, for which our mooring-place had just sufficient
depth of water.</p>

<p>For this test the crew all took up their submerging
stations, the submersion tanks were slowly opened
and the boat flooded with just sufficient water to
<a class="pagenum" name="page_085" title="85"> </a>
make her float, the conning-tower hatch still remaining
above the surface.</p>

<p>In this way the hull of the boat is made to
oscillate by means of the different water loads of
the two trimming tanks, and from this one can
judge if the balance of the boat is properly adjusted.
If after this it is found necessary to alter the
weights, the cargo is moved accordingly. One
last submerging and trimming test must then
follow, in order to make sure that the loading of the
whole boat agrees in every detail.</p>

<p>Thus her two thousand tons are brought into
perfect adjustment in the fluctuating displacement
of the water.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI<a class="pagenum" name="page_086" title="86"> </a><br />

<span class="subheader">THE DEPARTURE FROM BALTIMORE</span></h2>


<p>Above the description of our return voyage I
should like to put as a motto what the London
<i>Morning Post</i> of 18th July wrote regarding the
attitude of the English Government towards the
"Deutschland."</p>

<p class="pagenarrow">"The 'Deutschland,' in view of her
peculiar U-Boat qualities, will be considered as
a war vessel, and be treated as such.</p>

<p class="pagenarrow">"The warships of the Allies will therefore
make every effort to discover the boat outside
American territorial waters, and to sink her
without warning."</p>

<p>Thus ran a cablegram which reached America
from London on the 19th July. Thus we ourselves
read it in a copy of the <i>Morning Post</i> which was sent
to us at the end of July. There was at least
one advantage, that we knew exactly what we had
to expect.</p>

<p>Never has the English point of view been so
displayed in all its brutality.</p>

<p>We had no torpedo tubes, no guns on board, not
the smallest means of attack. We had not even
weapons of defence which are always allowed on
<a class="pagenum" name="page_087" title="87"> </a>
every English merchant ship. The most powerful
of the neutral states had moreover openly recognised
the "Deutschland" as a mere trading vessel,
and yet we were to be sunk without warning!</p>

<p>We knew, therefore, what lay before us.</p>

<p>It was already known that eight enemy warships
with patrol boats and nets were waiting in front of
Chesapeake Bay in order to attack us directly we
quitted American territorial waters, and to blow us
up like blind fish, with mines.</p>

<p>Foresight was therefore urgently impelled on us,
and our only course was, with true U-Boat craftiness,
to slip through somehow.</p>

<p>We remembered, moreover, how we had already
once succeeded in getting the best of the English
and French efforts. Our running of the English
blockade in Europe had certainly been by no means
a smooth pleasure trip.</p>

<p>Nothing had caused us greater amusement than
the news of the delightful announcement made by
Captain Gaunt of the English consulate in New
York when the first rumour was heard of the voyage
of a U-Boat to America. His reassuring words to
the English public were: "It is impossible to send
a U-Boat to America. And even if the Germans did
send one we should soon catch her. A big submarine
leaves a track of oil and machine dirt on the surface
of the waters in her wake. Our fast cruisers would
be able to follow these tracks and catch the boat for
a dead certainty."</p>

<p>Captain Gaunt is the expert on affairs of navigation
at the Consulate, and ought to know.</p>

<p>All we had to do, therefore, was to see to it that
<a class="pagenum" name="page_088" title="88"> </a>
their second "catch" was as much of a "dead
certainty" as the first.</p>

<p>At last the 1st of August arrived. We had taken
a hearty leave everywhere, completed all formalities
with the authorities, and were ready for sea
and for our rendezvous with the gentlemen in
front of the bay.</p>

<p>Our departure was delayed, as we were obliged
to wait for the high tide, in order to get from the
Patapsco River on which Baltimore is situated,
across the intervening muddy bar out into Chesapeake
Bay. The water rose very slowly during the
day, as a north wind was blowing and prevented
the tide in the long inlet from rising up quite as far
as Baltimore.</p>

<p>We waited excitedly for the rising of the water,
and at last, at five o'clock in the afternoon, the
moment arrived. The ropes were cast off, the
closely packed attendant boats made way, and the
"Deutschland" pushed majestically off from the
pier into the fairway. The tug "Timmins" ran
alongside of us like a faithful sheep-dog, snarling
at the many big and small boats full of reporters
and cinema people, if they approached too closely.</p>

<p>There was nothing to fear. The harbour police
boat from Baltimore had been very kindly lent us,
and the Customs boat from Maryland had received
instructions to accompany us as far as the boundary
line of their beat permitted.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people stood on the banks of the
Patapsco River, waving and cheering us incessantly
as we departed, and in the harbour all the tugs
hooted with the full blast of their sirens and hooters,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_089" title="89"> </a>
while the steamers dipped their flags and tooted.
It was an indescribable uproar. We knew as we
travelled on that the thoughts and blessings of
countless hearts throughout mighty America accompanied
us, and anxiously awaited the moment
which should bring them the certainty of our lucky
escape out yonder.</p>

<p>As soon as we got into the fairway with the
engines going at full speed, our attendants gradually
fell behind. Even "Timmins" had enough to do to
keep up with us. We noticed with pleasure how
slowly all the American boats travelled; the cheers
grew weaker and weaker, the number of boats ever
smaller, and at last only the Customs' cutter remained.
When towards seven o'clock she also
dropped off, we should have been alone with "Timmins"
but for one uncanny follower who was not
so easy to shake off. She was a smart grey boat
with pointed nose and flat short stern, a regular
first-class racing boat which, so rumour said, had
an 80 horse-power and could do her 22 knots. She
appeared to have been hired during the last ten
days by a man who paid the round sum of 200
dollars a day&mdash;by which it may be gathered how
highly he valued this chance of a bit of sport in
running a race with the "Deutschland."... By
10&nbsp;p.m. a fairly roughish sea had risen. The
lights of the racing boat dropped more and more
behind, and at grey dawn the following morning
the sea was empty&mdash;the racer had turned back
home.</p>

<p>In her place, however, a whole lot of fishing
trawlers appeared ahead of us in the dim morning
<a class="pagenum" name="page_090" title="90"> </a>
light, which made us fear that even here in neutral
waters we might run into a regular trap.</p>

<p>Cheers and hand-waving from the vessels soon
showed us our happy mistake; they were a party
of American Press representatives who, together
with a number of admirers and friends of the
"Deutschland," had refused to miss the opportunity
afforded by a night voyage of giving our
boat a farewell greeting at a distance of some
fifty miles from Baltimore.</p>

<p>One steamer after the other glided by, and the next
morning by six o'clock we were in sufficiently free
water to make our first submerging test. I wanted
to get the boat and crew firmly in hand again
after our prolonged stay on land&mdash;purely on account
of the "dead certainty" of that "catch."</p>

<p>We therefore made our first trial, and everything
went swimmingly. The "Timmins" stood by and
Captain Hinsch told me later that it was a marvellous
sight as the "Deutschland" dived in perfect
silence, only to reappear again a few minutes
later like a flash, her bow foaming, above the
water.</p>

<p>The submersion worked perfectly likewise. After
this, in order to see if everything was in working
order, I gave the command for the boat to come to
rest on the bottom at a spot which, according to
the map, should have had a depth of 16½ fathoms.</p>

<p>Once more all is still. The daylight fades; the
well-known singing and seething of the submersion
valves sounds in our ears. The gauge in the conning-tower
registers 11 fathoms, 13 fathoms; the
power is lessened; 16½ fathoms appears, and I await
<a class="pagenum" name="page_091" title="91"> </a>
the gentle impact with which the boat shall touch
on the ground....</p>

<p>Nothing of the kind happens.</p>

<p>Instead of this the hand moves round on its dial
to 17½, 18, 19 fathoms. I tap my finger on the
glass&mdash;quite all right, the hand is just turning to 20.
"What in the name of fortune's the matter?" I
think to myself, and take up the map.</p>

<p>Yes, 16½ fathoms are marked there and we had
taken exact bearings up above.... Nevertheless,
we continue to sink. Twenty-two fathoms are
registered on the dial plate.</p>

<p>This is too absurd. I call down to the control-room
and receive the comforting reply that on their
big depth gauge also, 22 fathoms have been registered
and passed. Our gauges coincide therefore.</p>

<p>This, however, does not prevent the boat from
sinking.</p>

<p>The men in the control-room look at each
other....</p>

<p>It is a ridiculous situation, to be sinking in this
confounded silence into the Unknown and not to
be able to see anything but the everlasting backward
jerking of that treacherous hand on the white
dial....</p>

<p>In the conning-tower it is no different. I glance
distractedly backwards and forwards from the
map to the gauge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the boat sinks deeper and deeper;
24 fathoms have gone by.... The hand is moving
towards 27.... I am just thinking that the deeps
of Chesapeake Bay must come to an end somewhere,
and that we can hardly be sinking into groundlessness
<a class="pagenum" name="page_092" title="92"> </a>
... when suddenly, without the least
shock, the boat comes to a halt at a depth of
27½ fathoms.</p>

<p>I scrambled down to the control-room and took
counsel with Klees and the two officers of the watch.</p>

<p>It could only be that we had struck a hole which
was not marked on the map. Well, this was nothing
serious, after all. Whether we had to rise from 16
or 27 fathoms was quite immaterial.</p>

<p>I was just about to give the order to rise to the
surface, when my glance fell on the gyro-compass,
which with its slowly jerking black and white disc
hangs usually so serenely in its case, which is lit up
from the inside....</p>

<p>I fell back in surprise....</p>

<p>What on earth had come over it? The disc of
the compass had gone quite mad and was turning
round and round with short jerky movements....</p>

<p>The affair began to grow distinctly uncomfortable.
Considering that our gyro-compasses are about the
most reliable of any in the whole world, and as at a
depth of 27 fathoms in Chesapeake Bay the earth
could hardly be revolving round us, there was only
one conclusion to be drawn, and that a confoundedly
unpleasant one.... We must be turning round
and round in our hole, for what reason the devil
only knew!</p>

<p>I immediately gave orders for the pumps to
be started, with the result that they started rattling,
but with a more clanking, empty noise, so to speak,
than usual.... They did not help us in the least;
we remained sticking in the mud, exactly as we were
before.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_093" title="93"> </a>
This was the last straw, and I must confess our
confidence began to waver somewhat.</p>

<p>In the meantime we had sunk a little deeper
according to the depth gauge, while, on the other
hand, the rolling had ceased and we lay perfectly
still.</p>

<p>Once more I gave energetic orders to rise immediately
to the surface. The pumps started rattling and
ran empty again. That was no good therefore.</p>

<p>The situation must be carefully thought out,
otherwise we should be lying in the same place till
morning.</p>

<p>After a lot of trouble the engineer, Klees, succeeded
in getting the pumps into working order
again.</p>

<p>With a deep humming sound they started pressing
the water out of the tanks&mdash;they were working!
As if transfixed our eyes sought the hand of the
depth gauge. Hurrah! we were coming free, we were
rising, the hand was pointing to 26 fathoms ...
could I trust my eyes ... what the devil was
that again? ... the gauge suddenly pointed to
11 fathoms ... then on again to 26 fathoms ...
and back to 11 once more....</p>

<p>The affair was now growing critical.... We
looked at each other, absolutely at the end of our
resources, not knowing what was wrong with the
boat or with ourselves, nor even at what depth we
were ... and now even the depth gauges had
gone mad!...</p>

<p>In order to understand what this means, it must
be clearly realised that in a submerged boat nothing
can be known or seen, except by means of the hands
<a class="pagenum" name="page_094" title="94"> </a>
of the depth gauge. If that once ceases to fulfil
its functions correctly, then you are absolutely "at
sea."</p>

<p>The situation had therefore grown very serious.
Nevertheless, an iron calm reigned in the boat.
We had the consolation that in the utmost emergency
we could use our compressed air, which could
not fail to bring us to the surface, even if the pumps
failed us.</p>

<p>There was, however, no need to resort to this.
Klees, who had been lost in thought, suddenly
gripped hold of one of the valves&mdash;a hissing noise
of compressed air, the depth gauge pointed wildly
to 66 fathoms then sprang back to 26 again ...
then the coating of slime which had stopped up the
spouts of the gauge was blown away by a little
of the compressed air.</p>

<p>The mouths of the pumps were also cleared by
means of the compressed air of all the mud and
slime which had worked in during our wild circular
movements; then the pumps commenced
humming in their usual tones, and the "Deutschland"
rose obediently to the surface.</p>

<p>We had been, however, one hour and a half
under water.</p>

<p>Captain Hinsch, in the "Timmins," came alongside
much relieved. He had been unable to understand
the meaning of our long submersion and had
grown extremely anxious.</p>

<p>We must apparently have got into some kind of
pit, where the sand was being "ground" and where,
owing to our circular movements, we dug our way
gradually into the slime and mud. I then posted
<a class="pagenum" name="page_095" title="95"> </a>
the "Timmins" at a distance of two miles away
for an observation of a last important submersion
test.</p>

<p>Our aim was, without advancing, to rise so that
the periscope appeared above water, which was by
no means an easy matter. It is naturally much
easier to get up to a certain position by utilising the
dynamical lift given by the diving rudders, but in
doing this the periscope makes a little track of foam
through the sea, which might under certain conditions
prove treacherous.</p>

<p>We tried, therefore, to lift ourselves from a greater
depth by oscillating up to a certain height and, by
alternately emptying and filling the tanks at that
depth, to reach a floating position in which only
our periscope should appear just above the water,
and that in a vertical direction.</p>

<p>The experiment succeeded. We were able to
stretch out our periscope feelers so that the "Timmins"&mdash;who
knew roughly our vicinity&mdash;did not
notice us before our conning-tower appeared above
the water.</p>

<p>I now felt certain that we were prepared for all
possibilities and could risk breaking through unobserved.
We continued therefore calmly on our
way with "Timmins" and regulated our course so
that we reached the exit between the capes just after
darkness had set in.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII<a class="pagenum" name="page_096" title="96"> </a><br />

<span class="subheader">RUNNING THE BLOCKADE</span></h2>


<p>Night had set in as we approached the danger zone.
In front of us sparkled the steady fire from Cape
Henry, while astern Cape Charles threw out her
lights at short intervals through the darkness.
With these as our bearings we went on calmly to
face the decision.</p>

<p>Suddenly two searchlights flashed out over the
water to starboard. The accursed rays passed
quick as lightning over the dark waves. I counted
several seconds mechanically, then the full glare
of the searchlight struck us in the eye....</p>

<p>It was already too late to submerge, and the
treacherous light held fast on to the "Deutschland."</p>

<p>A rapid glance passed between the two of us in
the tower, our features showed up distinctly in the
beautiful free illumination....</p>

<p>Then we saw that the rays of the searchlight,
after they had made sure of us, rose twice high in
the sky and suddenly disappeared. As our eyes
grew accustomed to the darkness again, we discovered
two black vessels to starboard which looked
like fishing trawlers.</p>

<p>"The cursed gang!" murmured Krapohl, at my
side; "now they have betrayed us!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_097" title="97"> </a>
And he was right, unfortunately.</p>

<p>For over yonder on the coast a gigantic searchlight
flashed high in the sky, obviously as a signal
to the English cruisers waiting outside.</p>

<p>"Now was the moment," I thought.</p>

<p>"Make ready to submerge," my orders rang out.</p>

<p>"Ten fathoms down!"&mdash;at the same time we
took a course to the south.</p>

<p>Half an hour later we rose to the surface again,
as I wanted to take my bearings once more. Hardly
had I taken a glance round, however, than we were
obliged to avoid immediate danger by submerging
again. For close by, barely 200 yards off, an
American armoured cruiser was bearing down
on us.</p>

<p>She also had seen the remarkable flash signals,
and was coming along to watch over the proceedings
in the vicinity of American territorial waters.
Although, according to the newspapers, the
armoured cruiser was supposed to have been
ordered into Chesapeake Bay for man&oelig;uvres,
I am of opinion that the American Government
had ordered the ship to go out to the three-mile
boundary line, in order to watch events in
connection with our escape. I am also personally
strongly convinced that the excellent tone in the
officers' mess and among the crews of the American
marine would not have allowed the men of the
armoured cruiser, in the event of any violation of
the territorial water zone, to restrict themselves
merely to observation, but that they would have
taken an energetic part in the proceedings.</p>

<p>That such a violation was not by any means
<a class="pagenum" name="page_098" title="98"> </a>
beyond the realms of possibility, and that it was
probably only prevented on that memorable night
by the sudden appearance of the American armoured
cruiser, is borne out by the following circumstance.
Several days before our departure an
English cruiser had passed Cape Henry under cover
of mist and darkness and searched the whole of
Chesapeake Bay in the most shameless manner,
after which, without making her identity known,
she disappeared again.</p>

<p>In the meantime we had quickly forced our boat
heavily down by the head into the deeps, and did not
rise to the surface again till the noise of the American's
propeller had died away in the distance.</p>

<p>We knew that the most dangerous moment of
our whole voyage was near at hand. We took a
careful view of the situation once more, and made
all the necessary preparations for our "Deutschland."</p>

<p>Then we submerged again and went on, all our
faculties strained to the uttermost, our nerves filled
to overflowing with that cold excitement which
inwardly, so to speak, causes one's hair to
stand on end, while outwardly one is quite calm,
gripped in that icily clear deliberation which only
comes to those who are fully conscious that they
are face to face with an unknown danger....</p>

<p>We knew our way. It had been already brought
to our knowledge that fishermen had been bribed
to lay nets in stated positions outside the three-mile
boundary line&mdash;nets in which we were to be caught
fast, in which, moreover, devilish mines had been
interwoven.... Or perhaps the nets might be
<a class="pagenum" name="page_099" title="99"> </a>
merely attached to buoys, which we should drag
along behind us, and thus betray our position....</p>

<p>We were prepared for all contingencies, and had
made everything ready to free ourselves from the
nets if the worst should happen. But the worst did
not happen.</p>

<p>It was a dark night. The lights from the two
capes shone calmly, with friendly eyes on land,
while a few miles farther out death lurked in every
conceivable form.</p>

<p>But while the English ships travelled backwards
and forwards, lighting up the waters with their
searchlights and seeking us in every conceivable
spot, they little knew that at times, close on their
heels, a periscope proceeded on its leisurely way,
and underneath this periscope&mdash;the "U&nbsp;Deutschland."</p>

<p>At 12&nbsp;p.m. that night, after hours of indescribable
tension, the command rang out: "Rise to the
surface!"</p>

<p>We were through.</p>

<p>Slowly the "Deutschland" rose through the water,
the tanks were blown out and the oil engines
started.</p>

<p>At full speed we rushed on out into the open
freedom of the Atlantic, while behind us in the
north-west, the English, with whole bundles of
searchlights, sought the waters in vain.</p>

<p>They must have grown somewhat irritable towards
the end!</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII<a class="pagenum" name="page_100" title="100"> </a><br />

<span class="subheader">THE HOMEWARD JOURNEY</span></h2>


<p>Never had the "Deutschland" travelled so swiftly
as in those early morning hours of the 3rd August.
With marvellous speed she raced on, leaving two
broad streaks of foam on either side.</p>

<p>The engines rumbled in perfect rhythm, the combustion
was working without a flaw, and the exhaust
showed not the slightest cloud, so that even
Herr Kiszling was thoroughly contented, and in a
moment of unconscious tenderness nearly stroked
the shaft of his beloved engines....</p>

<p>When the sun rose the coast had long disappeared
from sight in the distance in a grey mist, and there
was no vessel of any kind to be seen.</p>

<p>We remained on the surface and raced on like the
very devil. How much we owed to our engines!
On our arrival at Baltimore, after our long and
difficult journey they had been still in perfect
condition; no repairs were necessary, and we could
have made the return journey immediately without
their being overhauled. And yet the engines had
been obliged to work under quite unknown conditions,
under conditions which like that of the
terrible temperature in the Gulf Stream had made
<a class="pagenum" name="page_101" title="101"> </a>
the very highest and most unforeseen demands on
every part of the machinery.</p>

<p>It can be easily understood that hitherto there
had been no opportunity of testing the working
capabilities of oil motors in an outside temperature
of 127 degrees Fahrenheit. Such a contingency
could never have been foreseen in the construction
of our type of boat, and the fact that our motors
never struck, that not the least hitch arose, proves
the excellence of the construction and the perfect
workmanship of the dockyard.</p>

<p>Thus we continued on our way, and only too soon
found ourselves in the damp heated atmosphere
and heavy air of the Gulf Stream, with all its
beautiful phenomena and peculiarities, its electrically
laden air and stormy sea. With closed hatches
and heat in the boat we faced it once more. And
the Stream would not even help to push us along
on our course, as we had hoped.</p>

<p>All hardships were, however, borne with light
hearts this time. We had left the danger zone
behind us, and were homeward bound. Moreover,
the sea had become calmer the nearer we approached
the area of the Gulf Stream.</p>

<p>On the evening of the second day it had become
possible to open all the deck hatches again. Hardly
had we begun to rejoice that the fresh air would
now make conditions below deck bearable once
more, when suddenly the order came, "Close
hatches!" "Submerge!"</p>

<p>A steamer had appeared and was rapidly approaching
so directly in our course that we could
not possibly have avoided her above water.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_102" title="102"> </a>
When we rose to the surface again an hour later
night had set in, and with it appeared a most
marvellous natural phenomenon of sea phosphorescence
of unearthly splendour.</p>

<p>We had submerged in a calm dark sea; we now
arose to an ocean of flame. A sea phosphorescence
had set in of an intensity and glow such as I had
never before experienced, and which is probably
only to be found on the borders of the Gulf Stream.</p>

<p>During our rise, and when we were at about
2 fathoms below the surface, it seemed as if we were
working upwards through a glowing realm of sparkling
transparency. Shortly before the conning-tower
arose above water I glanced round astern,
and saw the entire hull of the boat, with the stern
like a dark mass pushing its way through the glowing
element. A fiery whirlpool radiated from the
propeller, and every movement of the boat aroused
the wildest phosphorescence&mdash;intensive flames,
sprays of sparks, and fiery streaks in the surrounding
waters.</p>

<p>Above, a fresh breeze had set in and whipped the
seething waters into glowing balls, while showers of
sparkling foam covered the entire deck. As far as
the eye could reach the surface of the sea was one
pale glowing mass, through which our boat ploughed
its way in furrows of fire.</p>

<p>We stood transfixed as the phenomenon increased
in intensity with the sea and wind.</p>

<p>All the men off duty came up and stared out
at this enchanting spectacle, little heeding the seas
which swept over the deck, soaking many of them
through to the skin.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_103" title="103"> </a>
"It looks like fire, don't it? But blowed if it
don't put yer pipe out," remarked our giant boatswain.
A spurt had just extinguished his pipe for
the third time, and he reluctantly decided to store
the beloved stump carefully in his pocket.</p>

<p>But the "fire" grew wetter and wetter, and within
half an hour the officers on duty and look-out stood
once more alone up in the conning-tower.</p>

<p>When we got out of the Gulf Stream we had
several days of stiff north-westerly winds and high
seas, until, on the &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;August, we ran into fine
weather again.</p>

<p>On one of the following evenings the first officer
on duty, Krapohl, was standing with Humke in the
conning-tower scanning the horizon without ceasing,
through the glasses, at a point where the pale
sky seemed to merge into the sea without any
observable boundary line.</p>

<p>"Light ahead," announced Humke suddenly.</p>

<p>"If you mean that star, I've noticed it already,"
the officer replied, calmly lowering his glasses.</p>

<p>"Wal, I dunno, but that there ain't no star,
Herr Krapohl," the sailor replied, unabashed.</p>

<p>The two called out to me, and I came expectantly
out of the tower, took the glasses and then
laughed.</p>

<p>"Humke, you're on the wrong track!" for I
noticed high up above the horizon a faint white
light which stood too high, judging by its strength,
to be a ship's light.</p>

<p>The boatswain stolidly maintained his opinion,
however.</p>

<p>"Cap'n, that there ain't no star."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_104" title="104"> </a>
I handed him the glasses which he, however, put
aside at once, remarking:</p>

<p>"Ye can't see nothink properly with them
things."</p>

<p>He shut his eyes tightly, then took another sharp
look and said in decided tones:</p>

<p>"That ain't no star; that be a light!"</p>

<p>We stared before us with increased sharpness
till I was able at last to make out through the glasses
a red glow which now became visible to the right
of the white light. Now we knew that a steamer
was approaching us.</p>

<p>At first I held her to be a small vessel, particularly
as, to begin with, the height of the
two lights differed but slightly&mdash;the red port light
of the steamer was not much below the white
light.</p>

<p>But soon I was surprised to observe how noticeably
the red light moved, that is to say, how quickly
the space between the two lights appeared to
increase.</p>

<p>From this there was only one possible conclusion
to be drawn, and that was that the vessel was
approaching with extraordinary rapidity.</p>

<p>While I was considering this, and picturing it to
myself as a swiftly travelling destroyer, I discovered
at a fair distance behind the two lights something
that looked like a white moving ray, or like a faintly
illuminated wave.</p>

<p>We could not make out what this meant till I
decided that this wave must belong to the lights
themselves, as they moved together and kept pace
with each other. And a few minutes later there
<a class="pagenum" name="page_105" title="105"> </a>
appeared tremblingly on the strong lens of the
glasses the faint outline of a mighty steamer, which
with elaborate superstructure was approaching in
the dark night. The white ray of light was her
stern water, which owing to the colossal length of
the ship was only visible at a considerable distance
from her side lights.</p>

<p>For some minutes longer we continued to stare,
then we discovered four towering funnels, and were
soon convinced that we had a big Cunard liner in
front of us which was racing up in semi-darkness,
only showing her head-lights.</p>

<p>It really was a ghostly apparition, to observe how
the mighty darkened ship raced on through the
night. There is not much need to be romantically
inclined in order to picture this meeting with the
"Flying Dutchman," while Humke expressed his
feelings in the words: "Lor', ain't she just a beauty,
lads!"</p>

<p>"Full speed ahead!" and with "helm hard astarboard"
we slipped away from the course of the
mighty Cunarder. All the men of the watch off
duty meanwhile had come up to get a view of her
from the deck and hatches.</p>

<p>In spite of a sharp look-out nothing appeared
in sight during the next few days. The weather
keeping fine our homeward journey&mdash;even more
than when we were outward-bound&mdash;assumed the
character of a peaceful, uneventful business
voyage.</p>

<p>It was now that we first began fully to appreciate
the convenient and practical inner fittings of the
whole boat, and particularly our cabins and cosy
<a class="pagenum" name="page_106" title="106"> </a>
little mess-room. Often as we sat round the table
at mess while the gramophones played gaily, we
thought with gratitude of those who had not only
invented the seaworthy shape of our boat, but had
fitted her interior up so that a life of comparative
comfort and ease was possible even under the
sea.</p>

<p>When on these occasions our gallant Stucke,
with his blonde white hair, his honest face full of
earnest gravity, and his habitually surprised expression
placed a bottle of good red Californian
wine in front of us, as we lay comfortably "somewhere"
at the bottom of the sea, while overhead,
at a height of X fathoms, a hearty wind was
blowing, it needed little imagination to picture
oneself as a second Captain Nemo, who with his
highly modern Nautilus could probe the depths,
and snap his fingers at the injustice and tyranny of
a certain people&mdash;provided, that is to say, one had
read Jules Verne.</p>

<p>For I must here confess, what I had hitherto
carefully concealed from everyone, that it was only
as captain of a submarine trader on my return
journey from America that I was enabled to make
good a very sad deficiency in my education. The
chance I had wasted in my youth I now came
across at the age of forty-nine in the steel body of
the "U&nbsp;Deutschland," of making myself acquainted
with Jules Verne's <i>Twenty Thousand Leagues under
the Sea</i>.</p>

<p>The book had been sent me while I was at Baltimore
through the kindness of an American friend.
It is a book&mdash;how shall I describe it?&mdash;of incitement
<a class="pagenum" name="page_107" title="107"> </a>
and emulation. I read it with the greatest
interest.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The rest of our return journey is soon told. We
travelled on smoothly and peacefully homewards,
avoiding a few distant steamers above water&mdash;in
which little game we had gradually become extremely
well practised&mdash;and meeting on the whole with good
weather, some mist, and much smooth sea.</p>

<p>One afternoon I was sitting working at the
writing-table in my cabin, when suddenly I heard
from the control-room close by the order "20 to
starboard" repeated. Immediately after came
"10 to port," whereupon, without waiting to hear
any more, I hurried on deck.</p>

<p>There a strange sight awaited me. All around,
as far as the eye could reach, the sea was covered
with a mass of dark, floating oil casks through which
we had to steer our way.</p>

<p>At first I took the black, weird-looking objects,
which danced up and down on the waves before us,
for a mine-field, until the characteristic shape of the
sharp angular casks, or so-called barrels, and their
contents which had spread partly over the water,
testified to their harmlessness. Nevertheless we
had to steer carefully through this strange plantation,
as the area was too wide a one to avoid without
going considerably out of our course. We estimated
the number of casks that were visible to us as at
least a thousand.</p>

<p>"Fine practice," remarked Krapohl, "for the
elegance with which we shall twist through the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_108" title="108"> </a>
English mine-fields later on. I think we might risk
the return through the English Channel."</p>

<p>We went on, therefore, at half-speed to port&mdash;starboard&mdash;port,
for over an hour. Scattered parts
of vessels were to be seen on the water, possibly the
results of wrecks or mines.</p>

<p>We must by this time have gradually come
within the sphere of the English look-out ships.
The watch was doubled, everyone standing at their
submerging stations.</p>

<p>From time to time we noticed vessels whose
attention we avoided by submerging or altering our
course. One warship, apparently a small English
cruiser, we allowed no possibility of seeing us by
immediately diving. When, after an hour's undersea
journey, we again rose slowly to the surface,
we saw from a depth of 6½ fathoms, through the
periscope, another English ship, and went down
again to 11 fathoms, and this was repeated three
times in succession.</p>

<p>At noon we rose at last for good, emptied the
tanks, and then travelled at top speed over the
water.</p>

<p>Favoured by the fine weather we approached
our goal with considerable rapidity; and on August&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;
at eight o'clock in the evening, we saw a circle
of white lights all round the horizon.</p>

<p>Our natural fear was, of course, that we were
surrounded; if we turned to starboard we saw
those accursed lights, to port&mdash;there they were
too.</p>

<p>Finally our excellent Zeiss glasses removed our
fears that at the last moment with the homeland
<a class="pagenum" name="page_109" title="109"> </a>
already in sight we had fallen into a trap. The
twilight was still clear enough to allow us to see and
recognize from the construction of the uncanny-looking
ships that only some harmless Dutch
fishing boats lay before us.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV<a class="pagenum" name="page_110" title="110"> </a><br />

<span class="subheader">THE ARRIVAL</span></h2>


<p>Favourable winds astern helped us on towards
home. On August&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash; at six o'clock in the morning,
our alarm was raised once more. In the far distance
something appeared on the water which looked
like the sail of a boat, though certainly of a very
strange appearance. As it approached nearer the
sail turned out to be the conning-tower of a U-Boat,
which, with her deck still dripping, was going on her
way.</p>

<p>Although we were at first inclined to take careful
and instructive observations of the strange object
in the distance, in order to judge how we ourselves
showed up at a distance of three knots, the best
course in our case appeared to be to find out
as quickly as possible if she were an English or a
German submarine.</p>

<p>We preferred, however, in any case to make
ourselves as unnoticeable as possible, and in the
last emergency to submerge.</p>

<p>We had already flooded up to tank 3, already the
sea broke over the deck and struck against the
conning-tower, and even the latter was cutting
half-way down through the green waters&mdash;when
suddenly a well-known flag signal rose yonder,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_111" title="111"> </a>
which gave us the certainty that it was a German
U-Boat in front of us.</p>

<p>We answered immediately, and gave the command
directly after:</p>

<p>"Empty the ballast tanks!"</p>

<p>Never had I given orders with such a cheerful
heart on the "Deutschland" before, and never
was it more cheerfully carried out than when I
called down to the control-room:</p>

<p>"Hurrah! the first German U-Boat in sight!"</p>

<p>What did it matter that we were standing on
the tower and the barely risen deck in oil and sea
water with a shower-bath playing over us?...
There, over the green North Sea, came the first
greeting of Germany, the mighty Fatherland,
towards us! At full speed we rushed on, everyone
on deck, and before long the two boats lay within
calling distance of each other.</p>

<p>The first ear-splitting hurrah was flung across to
us, and answered in like manner.</p>

<p>Then greetings and news were exchanged, and
our ways parted again ... ours towards home,
the U-X to her work.</p>

<p>The day drew in and night fell once more. So we
travelled homewards, no light on deck, no light in
the tower&mdash;like a dark shadow.</p>

<p>When the sun rose, however, on the following
morning, we saw before us in the distance a characteristic
silhouette, breaking through the veil of
mist in a rosy light. An island, a bulwark in the
North Sea&mdash;Heligoland lay before us.</p>

<p>Soon life began to awaken on the waters around
us. Torpedo-boats shot up, patrol boats hurried
<a class="pagenum" name="page_112" title="112"> </a>
along, flag signals fluttered in the air, wireless
signals rattled out their greetings, and shouting and
hand-wavings commenced, and then the iron ring
of the German Fleet, which keeps safe watch over
yonder, closed round our little "Deutschland,"
and under their protection we steered on past
Heligoland towards the home haven.</p>

<p>But as we approached the well-known waters,
even before the low homelike sandy coast came in
sight, a wonderful spectacle fell to our lot, the
strangest of greetings carried out with the utmost
skill.</p>

<p>From the land two huge birds seemed to rise into
the air&mdash;two seaplanes which approached at full
speed and then sank like gigantic water-fowls on
the gently moving surface of the sea.</p>

<p>They shot down with their floats just brushing
the surface of the water, till within a stone's throw
of the "Deutschland," made a lightning turn,
crashing by us, approached again and sprang
literally over our heads, racing low down over the
conning-tower, with cheers and waving of caps....</p>

<p>This was our reception from the latest weapon of
the German Navy.</p>

<p>One should not make comparisons. But as we
once more approached the German coast, surrounded
and protected by the German Marine, I
suddenly found myself comparing this with our
arrival in America.</p>

<p>No one could have been received with more hearty
enthusiasm than we had been by the Americans.
A free, untroubled people, they rejoiced in a bold
deed, and openly declared their sympathy for a new
<a class="pagenum" name="page_113" title="113"> </a>
and unheard of enterprise, which it had required
men to fulfil.</p>

<p>But here we were more than bold and interesting
adventurers. Here our own people received us again
as helpmates in their mighty struggle. Here the
delightful spectacle of her power under the sea, on
the sea, and in the air was presented to us.</p>

<p>This was for me the real meaning of the glorious
greeting of our airmen. This was what I felt as the
look-out boats accompanied us safely as far as the
outer Weser, where we cast anchor before the
Hohenweg lighthouse, for the first time after
many a long day.</p>




<h2>CHAPTER XV<a class="pagenum" name="page_114" title="114"> </a><br />

<span class="subheader">THE RECEPTION OF THE "DEUTSCHLAND" BY<br />
THE GERMAN PEOPLE</span></h2>


<p>From the outskirts of Heligoland as far as the outer
Weser we had been received by the Navy. On the
voyage up the Weser and at Bremen the whole
nation received us.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 23rd August the "Deutschland"
had struck anchor at the mouth of the Weser.
The news had been spread by telegraph throughout
the whole country&mdash;this longed-for news, which
awakened unbounded rejoicings.</p>

<p>We learnt to our surprise and proud delight that
the arrival of the "Deutschland" was to inaugurate
a festive holiday for the whole German people, that
such a reception awaited our little boat on the banks
of the Weser as surely never fell to the lot of any
"lucky ship" before. Our journey up the Weser
assumed the nature of a triumphal procession.
Behind the hundreds of thousands who had come to
meet us and stood cheering on the banks, stood
invisible the millions of German people inspired
with the same feeling.</p>

<p>This was expressed to us everywhere in overwhelming
rejoicings from old and young, high and
low, from the German Kaiser down to the merest
<a class="pagenum" name="page_115" title="115"> </a>
dock worker and the small ragged urchin who, full
of enthusiasm, waved his flag and shouted in the
streets of Bremen.</p>

<p>On the 25th August, early in the morning, the
"Deutschland" commenced her triumphal trip up
the Weser. It poured in torrents, but nothing could
quench the public rejoicings as we moved along
accompanied by the blockaded steamers, our masts
and conning-tower decorated with garlands of roses.</p>

<p>Low hung the dark clouds in the heavens, and the
rain pelted down on the thousands who stood on
the dykes or who had come to meet us on steamers,
barges, launches, and rowing boats. Deafening
cheers arose from the town, and the clashing of
bells mingled with the joyful acclamations, while
above it all rose the song of "Deutschland, Deutschland
über alles," which on that very day was celebrating
its seventy-fifth birthday.</p>

<p>In Nordenham, Brake, Blumenthal, flags salute,
guns thunder out, factory and steamer whistles send
their piercing greetings; shouts of welcome and
good wishes ring out from the North German Lloyd
steamers, to which we respond by waving back.</p>

<p>Vegesack is passed, where work on the Vulcan
Docks has ceased, the dockers standing in hundreds
on the quay. Their wild cheers accompany the
"Deutschland" on her triumphal way. The inhabitants
of Vegesack are all assembled at the
landing-place and on the banks behind.</p>

<p>Again music and singing, the roar of guns and
storms of rejoicing! Thicker and thicker grow the
crowds as the ship nears her home haven.</p>

<p>Shortly before twelve we reached Lankenau,
<a class="pagenum" name="page_116" title="116"> </a>
whose dyke had been chosen as an observation
point by the whole of Bremen, it appeared. Elbow
to elbow the people stood waving with hats, umbrellas,
handkerchiefs, hands....</p>

<p>At noon punctually the "Deutschland" sailed
into the open harbour, and placed her invited
guests, 'mid sounds of "Deutschland über alles," on
the highly decorated pontoon, on which the Grand
Duke of Oldenburg, the representatives of the
Bremen Senate and burghership, the civilian and
military authorities, the marine, the shipping
officials, etc., and among them Count Zeppelin,
were all assembled to receive us.</p>

<p>As soon as the ship was moored I called the men
up to take their positions on deck. Dr. Lohmann
then addressed us in the following speech:</p>

<p>"Your Royal Highness, Your Magnificencies,
Your Excellencies, My very honoured friends,&mdash;At
this historical moment of the happy return of the
first submarine merchant-trader of the world, after
a voyage of 8,500 knots, I here welcome our
'Deutschland' and her gallant crew, not only in
the name of our shipping officials, but of the whole
German people, back to the harbour of their
homeland. Quietly and only known to an initiated
few, they left the Weser, passed through and under
the English Fleet, to arrive on the 10th July at
Baltimore with a valuable cargo of dyes. Their
arrival was a surprise to the whole world. Even
navigation experts shortly before this event had
declared it to be an impossible undertaking.</p>

<p>"It is with particular pleasure that I am able to
state that all true Americans who are not demoralised
<a class="pagenum" name="page_117" title="117"> </a>
by a degrading Mammon service to England&mdash;men
with the freedom-loving instincts of a Washington
and a Franklin, greeted the arrival of the 'Deutschland'
in America with warmest satisfaction. It is
the pride of our shipping officials that we have been
able to send dyes to America under the German
flag in the middle of this war, while America herself
cannot even get her post from Europe unmolested,
to say nothing of the many other violations of the
rights of humanity by sea and land on the part of
our enemy, in connection with the neutrals, and
particularly the small states.</p>

<p>"To accomplish this has been the work of the
crew of the 'Deutschland.' Though they started
off without any previous announcement, their
departure from Baltimore was made publicly known
beforehand. 'It resembled a triumphal procession,'
wrote Havas, 'and a symbol of freedom.' I
myself should like to compare the deed with our
German view of the 'Rights of the Peoples on the
free Ocean.' The enemy were not able to prevent
their departure from Chesapeake Bay, and a blockaded
North Sea did not exist for them on their
return voyage, as will be proved by the many
million marks' worth of goods which have to-day
been brought from America, and which lie at this
moment before our eyes.</p>

<p>"They have performed a task of seamanship that
is worthy of our Hanseatic forefathers. Everywhere
throughout German lands, and among our faithful
allies, but particularly among our brothers in the
trenches and in the fleet, their return voyage has been
followed with deepest sympathy. With strongest
<a class="pagenum" name="page_118" title="118"> </a>
confidence in their judgment, energy, and sense
of duty, we members of the shipping world have
looked forward to their return. After their long
and strenuous weeks in the narrow confines of a
ship, face to face with unscrupulous enemies, I
welcome them heartily back to the Homeland. In
the midst of this murderous war I convey to them
the thanks of our German people for their peaceful
deed. And I should like to express these thanks by
calling for three cheers for the 'Deutschland,' her
commander, Captain König, her officers and crew.
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!"</p>

<p>I answered with a brief toast to the Senate and
burghership of the free Hansa city Bremen. We
then boarded the pontoon, where each one of us
was saluted and drawn into conversation by the
Grand Duke of Oldenburg and the other gentlemen
present.</p>

<p>After completing a distance of 8,450 knots, from
which only about 190 under water must be deducted,
the first submarine merchant-trader had reached
home. The "Deutschland's" first voyage to
America was completed.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>On the evening of this memorable day a big dinner
was given at the Town Hall by the Municipality of
the borough of Bremen, to celebrate the homecoming
of the "Deutschland." The speeches that
were delivered on this occasion give a short outline
of the circumstances which led to the building of
the "Deutschland," and for this reason they shall
be repeated here.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_119" title="119"> </a>
Dr. Barkhausen, the Mayor, had received his
guests with words of hearty welcome, and informed
them of the Municipality's decision to have a special
medal struck in memory of the day, and had then
toasted the German shipping officials, and the crew
of the submarine merchant-trader "Deutschland."</p>

<p>In the name of the Shipping Federation, their
chief representative, Dr. A. Lohmann, replied in the
following words:</p>

<p>"Your Magnificencies, Your Excellencies, my
most honoured gentlemen,&mdash;In the name of the
commander of the 'Deutschland,' Captain König,
and of his officers and crew, I wish to express
to the Municipality their most heartfelt thanks, as
also that of the Shipping Federation, for the great
honour granted by the Municipality to the crew of
the 'Deutschland' in allowing a medal to be
struck in commemoration of this peaceful commercial
deed in the midst of war.</p>

<p>"I wish to thank your Excellencies for the words
in which you have graciously acknowledged the
work of my colleagues and myself. Since the outbreak
of war I have gladly and willingly devoted
my efforts towards the welfare of the State. The
conviction that our splendid people, in spite of the
superior force of the enemy, are not to be crushed
in this defensive war for their individuality and
freedom, that the intellectual power and forethought
which inspire our entire people, their thorough
training since the wars of liberation, and the inborn
sense of duty which has come down to every
German in flesh and blood, are not to be overcome,
this conviction has accompanied me throughout all
<a class="pagenum" name="page_120" title="120"> </a>
my efforts, and everywhere I have met faithful
colleagues who were of the same opinion.</p>

<p>"I should like therefore at this point to express
my heartfelt thanks to all my fellow-workers, and
in particular to Herr Direktor Stapelfeldts, and my
colleagues on the Board, Herr General-Direktor
Heineken, and Herr Hermann, Councillor of Commerce.
The German Ocean Shipping Federation
was formed, as your Excellencies have already
stated, in all secrecy, and their task consisted in
forwarding goods of the utmost possible value.</p>

<p>"It meant, moreover, purchasing the raw
materials on the other side, their careful warehousing,
the placing of the 'Deutschland' in a safe
position, and protecting her from all attacks. This
was carried out to perfection by the North German
Lloyd agents, Herr Paul Hilken and his father,
Herr Hilken, Senior, as well as by Captain Hinsch
and his co-operators. The share which Captain
König and his officers and crew took in the enterprise
has already been brought into prominence by
your Excellencies. For my part and on behalf of
the shipping directors, I should like here once more
to tender our fellow-workers on the 'Deutschland'
our very hearty thanks.</p>

<p>"It will interest the gentlemen present to hear
something of the history of the German Ocean
Shipping Federation and of the 'Deutschland,'
the 'Bremen,' and her as yet unnamed sister ships.</p>

<p>"When in September, 1915, it became evident
that, in spite of all the successes of the Central
Powers, the war would continue for many months
<a class="pagenum" name="page_121" title="121"> </a>
yet, it was obvious that Germany's demand for
rubber and metals was of burning necessity.</p>

<p>"I therefore took the shipbuilding authorities in
Bremen into my confidence, after I had held
counsel with one of the most prominent shipbuilding
experts. The 'Weser' declared itself
ready to draw up and carry out the plans for a submarine
boat of about 500 tons carrying power. On
the 3rd October I came into possession of the completed
plans of this boat. The period of construction
unfortunately ran into eleven months, the
delivery being therefore completed about September
1st, 1916, for the docks were first obliged to have
the motors built. It was obvious that we must
make an effort another time if possible to reach our
object more quickly. Almost at the same time that
the practical evolution of a submarine merchantman
was under our consideration, the Germania
Dock at Kiel had, unknown to us, handed over at
the beginning of October to their chief house,
Friedrich Krupp and Sons, plans for the construction
of a U-Boat of about 700 tons carrying capacity.</p>

<p>"The Germania Docks were prepared, in the short
space of six months, to deliver the first boat, the
'Deutschland,' as early as April.</p>

<p>"Both plans, those of the Germania Docks as
well as my own, showed that the project was possible
to carry out, and I should like to compare this
community of ideas with a happy marriage, where
husband and wife are in perfect harmony with each
other&mdash;the dockyard, as the mother who brings the
child into the world and gives it to the father&mdash;the
shipowners and commerce&mdash;to place it in the
<a class="pagenum" name="page_122" title="122"> </a>
world. The soul and mind of the child were incorporated
in our Captain, our officers and crew,
who have performed the glorious task of taking the
'Deutschland' to America and back.</p>

<p>"On the 15th October we had come to an agreement,
and the construction of two boats was taken
over by the Germania Docks from the Syndicate.
The formal part of the establishment of the German
Ocean Shipping Federation was delayed somewhat.
Its establishment took place on the 8th November,
and the boats which had in the meantime been
ordered by our Syndicate were already under construction
as far as their framework. The 'Deutschland'
was delivered over to us at the beginning of
April.</p>

<p>"It was a wonderful masterpiece of the Germania
Docks, and, as is usual with all the work of Messrs.
Friedrich Krupp and Sons, it was perfectly carried
out. Before we sent our 'Deutschland' to America,
we made trial trips with her for over two months.
The execution of the work proved to have been
carried out perfectly in every respect. Captain
König was able to announce from America that after
a voyage of over 4,000 knots ship and machinery
were in perfect working order; his report on arriving
here in Bremen harbour was just the same. It
is a masterpiece of German technique, and the
name of Messrs. Krupp and Sons appears in shining
colours once again.</p>

<p>"From the creation of our artillery, from the 42's
down to the smallest specimen of ship guns that
began successfully to break the chain of the British
Fleet in the Skagerrack and prepare the way for
<a class="pagenum" name="page_123" title="123"> </a>
free trade among the nations, to the production of
arms and war material of every description&mdash;the
German people now owe their thanks for this
perfect piece of construction to the ingenious leaders
and directors of the greatest works in the world.
Without Krupp, our enemies would not now, after
two years of war, be standing everywhere on the
other side of their boundary lines.</p>

<p>"The intelligent co-operation of mind and body,
the employment of all the newest scientific discoveries,
added to the true German sense of duty,
these are the qualities that have made Krupp and
Sons famous. To-day, on the return of the 'Deutschland,'
we are face to face with another wonderful
production of shipbuilding technique on the part
of the firm of Krupp, and for this also the German
people owe their thanks to them. I should like to
ask you all, gentlemen, to give expression to these
thanks by joining with me in three hearty cheers.</p>

<p>"The firm of Friedrich Krupp and Sons, Germania
Docks. Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!"</p>

<p>After the next course, Herr Zetzmann, the
Director of the Germania Docks at Kiel, proceeded
as follows:</p>

<p>"Your Magnificencies, Your Excellencies, Most
honoured gentlemen,&mdash;To my lot has fallen the
honour of expressing in the name of the firm of
Friedrich Krupp and Sons and of the Germania
Docks, our heartiest thanks for the invitation that
has been extended us to-day by the Municipality,
and I also take the liberty of extending my thanks
to the distinguished guests of the Corporation
assembled here.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_124" title="124"> </a>
"... Herr Lohmann has made some interesting
communications in his speech with regard to the
history of the origin of the German Ocean Shipping
Federation, and I should like to add a few words
about the workshop from which the 'Deutschland'
and 'Bremen' sprang. We had been forced to
admit for some time past, that owing to the continued
duration of the war the need of certain
building materials was becoming increasingly
urgent.</p>

<p>"From the conversational remarks 'it might be
possible,' and 'we really ought to,' arose the decision
to consider seriously the possibility of a new kind
of trading vessel.</p>

<p>"The decision was no easy one, not merely
because we feared the difficulty of construction, but
because we hardly dared to place a fresh load on
our building yards, which were already heavily
overburdened with war orders. But necessity
teaches how to beg,&mdash;and also how to construct!
We next tried to work on the foundations of our war
boats, in the hope that by this means we should
lessen the constructional work. We found, however,
that on these lines reliable tonnage capacity and
carefully measured space were not to be attained.</p>

<p>"Our leading constructors advised me, therefore,
to go radically to work, and not to try and make a
trader out of a warship, but to create a new type
of trading boat altogether. The shape of this was
to be made full and rounded, and exact calculations
gave us a better tonnage, much to our surprise and
pleasure, than we had anticipated at the commencement
of our project. With wild enthusiasm our
<a class="pagenum" name="page_125" title="125"> </a>
constructors completed their plans, and soon we
stood face to face with a picture whose transformation
into reality would express our every wish.</p>

<p>"... Herr Krupp von Bohlen and the Directors
seized on our proposal with the greatest energy ...
and declared that a boat of this type must most
certainly be produced, and in the shortest possible
space of time, that moreover the Germania Docks
would begin directly on the construction of the
boat on their own responsibility.</p>

<p>"... Everything went like clockwork....
There remains only one thing more for me to say.
That we succeeded in completing the first boat in
so short a space of time is due in a great measure to
our principal firm and to our contractors, who
delivered all our building materials and necessary
fittings in spite of the other great demands that were
made upon them, with astonishing rapidity.</p>

<p>"I wish particularly to express my appreciation
that all the dealings with the German Ocean Shipping
Federation, and later with the staff of the
boat, were completed in the most friendly of spirits.
Both Shipping Federation and command staff have
met all our proposals with the greatest confidence.</p>

<p>"It is owing to this intelligent and broad-minded
preference that the rapidity of the construction was
made possible, and that the trial voyages went so
smoothly. With the greatest confidence, therefore,
we saw the ship undertake her first voyage.</p>

<p>"Our confidence has brilliantly justified itself.
Our most ardent wishes with which we followed
this product of our dockyard have been fully
realised.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="page_126" title="126"> </a>
"We wish the Shipping Federation further brilliant
successes of this kind, the 'Deutschland' and
her sister ships many equally happy voyages, for
the welfare of our beloved Fatherland, and for the
glory of our revered Hansa city, Bremen.</p>

<p>"To-day's celebration will be for all who have
taken part in it a remembrance that they will
carry to the end of their lives, and the celebration
has been brought to a close in the most approved
fashion by the dinner given in the new Town Hall
by the Municipality. When this new part of the
Town Hall has grown as time-worn as the old,
perhaps tales will be told of how the successful
ocean voyage of the first submarine merchant-trader
in the world was celebrated here.</p>

<p>"Together with our thanks for the splendid feast,
I should like to join my good wishes for Bremen,
and I ask the honourable gentlemen present to join
in the toast: 'Long life and prosperity to the
Municipal Corporation of the free Hansa City of
Bremen and to the town of Bremen. Hurrah!
Hurrah! Hurrah!'"</p>
